c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">This volume is a museum-quality chronicle of a remarkable American journey, tracing the Konecny family&#39;s lineage across four centuries of the nation&#39;s history. It is the story of two great migratory streams&mdash;one beginning in the Puritan villages of 17th-century England, the other in the farmsteads of 19th-century Bohemia&mdash;that flowed across a continent and converged in the heart of the American Midwest. This is the story of how the descendants of Mayflower Pilgrims and Czech immigrants became one family, culminating in the life of Christopher Peter Konecny.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The narrative begins in 1620 on the storm-tossed Atlantic, aboard a small vessel carrying a determined band of Separatists. Among them were John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley, whose survival and marriage in the nascent Plymouth Colony would establish a foundational American lineage. Over the next three hundred years, their descendants&mdash;the Wood family and their kin&mdash;would participate in the shaping of a new nation. They were pioneers who pushed into the frontiers of New England, patriots who fought in the Revolutionary War, and adventurous souls who joined the New England Planters in settling Nova Scotia. They were also the &quot;original proprietors&quot; of the Quabbin Valley, whose ancestral lands were later sacrificed for the progress of a modernizing Massachusetts.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">In the late 19th century, a second story began. Fleeing economic hardship and seeking opportunity in the New World, the Konecny family made their own transatlantic passage from Bohemia to the bustling industrial towns of Wisconsin.

The year was 1620, and the ship was the </span><span class="c13">Mayflower</span><span class="c5">. Onboard were the spiritual and biological progenitors of the family&#39;s colonial line: John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley, Christopher Konecny&#39;s 11th great-grandparents.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;Their journey was a testament to the profound faith and fortitude that would become a hallmark of their descendants for generations to come.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The voyage was a brutal sixty-six-day ordeal. During one particularly violent storm, John Howland, a young indentured servant in his late twenties, was swept from the deck into the churning sea. In a moment that has become legendary in Pilgrim lore, he managed to grasp a trailing topsail halyard, clinging to it until the crew could haul him back aboard with a boathook. His miraculous survival was seen by his companions as an act of Providence, a sign that he was destined for a special purpose in the new land.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Upon their arrival in the unfamiliar waters of Cape Cod in November, far north of their intended destination in Virginia, the Pilgrims faced a crisis of governance. To establish a civil society and prevent dissent among the mixed group of &quot;Saints&quot; (Separatists) and &quot;Strangers&quot; (secular colonists), 41 of the adult male passengers, including John Howland, drafted and signed the Mayflower Compact. This seminal document, a covenant of self-government based on &quot;just and equal laws,&quot; was the first framework of its kind in the New World. It was a radical act of social contract that laid a cornerstone for American democracy and established a civic-minded heritage that would echo down through the family line.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c18">2</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The Pilgrims&#39; first winter was a time of devastating hardship. Disease, malnutrition, and exposure claimed nearly half of the 102 passengers. Among the dead were the parents of Elizabeth Tilley, a young girl of about thirteen, leaving her an orphan in a stark and unforgiving wilderness.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Yet, like John Howland, she endured. Around 1623, John and Elizabeth married, their union symbolizing the hope and resilience of the colony itself. They went on to have ten children, all of whom survived to adulthood and married, creating a vast network of descendants that would spread across the continent.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;Their progeny became a veritable river flowing through American history, a testament to the strength of the family they founded in the harshest of conditions.</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h4 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Historical Context: Life in Plymouth Colony</span></h4><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">For the first generation of settlers, life was a daily struggle for survival defined by hard labor and unwavering faith. Their homes were simple wattle-and-daub structures with dirt floors and thatched roofs, offering meager protection against the harsh New England winters. Their diet consisted of what they could grow, hunt, or catch. They learned from the native Wampanoag people, particularly the English-speaking Tisquantum (Squanto), to cultivate maize (corn), which became their staple crop alongside beans and squash. This was supplemented with fish, shellfish, wild fowl, and game like deer and turkey. Governance was conducted through town meetings, a direct application of the principles laid out in the Mayflower Compact, where free men of the colony debated and voted on matters of civil and religious importance. It was a life of profound interdependence, where the survival of each family was tied to the well-being of the community as a whole.</span></p><hr><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h4 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Notable Descendants: The Howland-Tilley Presidential Connection</span></h4><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The legacy of John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley extends far beyond their immediate family, weaving through the highest echelons of American power. Their vast network of descendants includes at least three United States Presidents: Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush. This remarkable fact underscores the profound and far-reaching impact of this single Pilgrim couple, whose survival against all odds helped seed a lineage that would continue to shape the nation&#39;s destiny for centuries.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c6 c18"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Chapter 2: Planting Roots in Plymouth Colony: The Wood Family Emerges</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">While the Howland-Tilley line established the family&#39;s Mayflower bona fides, the surname that would carry this legacy through the centuries first appears in colonial records two decades later. Henry Wood, the progenitor of this branch of the family, was documented in Plymouth Colony by 1641. His arrival marks the beginning of the Wood family&#39;s own distinct American story, one that would soon intertwine with the Pilgrim founders.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">In 1644, Henry Wood married Abigail Jenney in a union that solidified his place within the colony&#39;s established community. Abigail was the daughter of John Jenney, a Pilgrim who had arrived in Plymouth on the ship </span><span class="c13">Fortune</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;in 1621. Jenney was a respected brewer and miller who had built the colony&#39;s first grist mill, a vital piece of infrastructure for the growing settlement.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Through this marriage, Henry Wood not only started a family but also connected himself to the core group of early Pilgrim settlers. He and Abigail established their homestead in Middleborough, Massachusetts, a town just west of Plymouth that would become the Wood family&#39;s ancestral home for generations. Records show Henry as an active participant in colonial society, a landowner who served on juries and contributed to the civic life of the burgeoning community.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The family line continued through their son, David Wood, and grandson, Jabez Wood Sr. It was in Jabez&#39;s generation that the two primary streams of the family&#39;s colonial heritage converged. In January 1720, Jabez Wood Sr. (born 1691) married Hannah Nelson of Middleborough. Hannah was a great-granddaughter of John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;This marriage is the pivotal moment when the Mayflower bloodline flowed directly into the Wood family&#39;s ancestry. Their children, and all subsequent generations, would carry the dual heritage of the Woods and the Pilgrims who had crossed the Atlantic a century before.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">This period also offers a compelling example of how genealogical research can illuminate the past and solve long-standing family mysteries. The original handwritten family tree contained a confusing note about the wife of David Wood (son of Henry). Diligent research into primary sources, such as colonial marriage registries, resolved the question. The records show that in 1685, David married a woman named Mary Barker. Her full name in the records appeared as Mary Barker (Pratt Coombs), which explained the confusion; she was a widow who had been married twice before, first to a Pratt and then to a Coombs.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;This small but significant discovery not only clarified the family tree but also demonstrated the complex, interwoven nature of life in the small, close-knit communities of Plymouth Colony.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c18">4</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c6 c18"></span></p><h4 class="c22"><span class="c14">Historical Context: The Ship </span><span class="c38">Fortune</span><span class="c14 c7">&nbsp;(1621)</span></h4><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">While the </span><span class="c13">Mayflower</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;holds a singular place in American history, the arrival of the ship </span><span class="c13">Fortune</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;in November 1621 was a critical, near-catastrophic event for the fledgling Plymouth Colony.

However, the ship arrived with virtually no provisions&mdash;no food, no tools, and no extra clothing. Its arrival just before the onset of winter placed an immense strain on the Pilgrims&#39; already meager food stores, which had been carefully rationed after a modest first harvest. The colony was immediately put on half-rations, and the winter that followed was a period of severe hunger and hardship, known as the &quot;starving time.&quot; The arrival of the </span><span class="c13">Fortune</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;serves as a stark reminder of how precarious the colony&#39;s existence was in its first years.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><hr><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c6 c18"></span></p><h2 class="c22"><span class="c27 c7">Part II: Revolutionary and Civil War Era</span></h2><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Chapter 3: Patriots and Pioneers: The Wood Family in Revolutionary Times</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">As the 18th century progressed, the descendants of the Plymouth settlers were no longer just colonists clinging to the edge of a continent; they were Americans, forging a new identity in a land they had now occupied for over 150 years. When the call for independence from Britain echoed through the towns and farms of New England, the Wood family was there to answer it.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The central figure of this generation is Philip Wood, born in 1756, a direct ancestor who is noted in family records as a soldier in the Revolutionary War.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Living through the tumultuous years of protest, rebellion, and war, his generation witnessed the birth of the United States. While the full details of his service await confirmation from military archives, the record of a Philip Wood from Middleborough serving as a Corporal in Captain Amos Wade&#39;s 3rd Middleborough Company provides a strong and compelling lead.</span><span class="c6">5</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;Men like Philip formed the backbone of the colonial militias and the Continental Army. They were farmers, artisans, and laborers who left their homes to fight for the cause of liberty, participating in a conflict that would forever alter the course of their family&#39;s and their nation&#39;s history.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The end of the war and the establishment of an independent nation unleashed a new wave of migration. With the frontier now open for settlement, many New England families looked northward and westward for fresh land and new opportunities. The Wood family was part of this movement. Philip&#39;s son, Samuel Wood (born 1787), exemplifies this pioneering spirit. He first moved north to the newly formed state of Vermont before relocating again across the border to Quebec, Canada.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;This move highlights the fluid nature of the northern frontier in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. For families seeking land, the border was less a firm line and more a permeable boundary, with communities and family ties stretching across both sides of the new international divide. This pioneering impulse, a desire to push into new territories, was a direct inheritance from their Pilgrim forebears and a trait that would continue to define the family&#39;s journey for the next century.</span></p><hr><p class="c17 c19"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h4 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Historical Context: New England Families in the Revolutionary War</span></h4><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">The American Revolution was a deeply personal and local affair for the families of New England. Unlike modern conflicts fought by professional armies overseas, the war was ever-present. Towns were required to meet quotas of enlisted men, and it was common for fathers, sons, and brothers to serve together in the same local militia companies. When the alarm bell rang, as it did in April 1775, these men would grab their muskets and march to face the British regulars. For the women and children left behind, the war meant running farms and businesses, enduring shortages of goods, and living with the constant anxiety of news from the battlefield. The conflict fundamentally reshaped these communities, forging a powerful sense of shared sacrifice and a fierce commitment to the new republic they were helping to create.</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Chapter 4: From Independence to Union: Family Life through the Civil War</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">The 19th century was a period of profound transformation for the United States, and the Wood family&#39;s story mirrors the nation&#39;s restless, westward-surging energy. The descendants of the Massachusetts colonists were no longer bound to the Atlantic coast. Following the paths of countless other American families, they moved steadily west, seeking land, opportunity, and a new future in the heart of the continent.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">By the mid-1800s, the family&#39;s center of gravity had shifted decisively from New England to the burgeoning Midwest. The line of descent traces this migration clearly: Franklin Wood, born in 1815, lived in New York State, a common stop on the westward trail.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;His son, George S. Wood, was born in 1858 in Chicago, a city that was rapidly transforming from a frontier outpost into a bustling hub of commerce and industry.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;This generational leap from the East Coast to the Midwest encapsulates the great narrative of American westward expansion. The family was part of a massive demographic shift that settled the Great Lakes region and turned the vast interior into the nation&#39;s agricultural and industrial heartland.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">As the nation expanded, however, it also fractured. The coming of the Civil War in 1861 tested the very existence of the republic their ancestors had helped to build. By this time, the Wood family and their related kin, such as the Bentleys and Wagners, were established in Illinois and Wisconsin&mdash;states firmly in the Union camp.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;While no direct records of military service in the Civil War have been passed down, the family lived the experience of the home front. They were citizens of a nation at war, contributing to the Union cause through taxes, production, and the unwavering support of their communities. They would have followed the news of distant battles like Gettysburg and Vicksburg, celebrated Union victories, and mourned the staggering cost of the conflict. Their lives were shaped by the great questions of the era&mdash;slavery, states&#39; rights, and the preservation of the Union.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">By the end of the 19th century, the family&#39;s westward journey had reached its destination. George S. Wood married Mary Wagner Bentley, and the family was firmly established in the area of Two Rivers, Wisconsin.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;They had completed a 250-year migration that began on the shores of Plymouth. In doing so, they had positioned themselves in the very place where their long colonial story was destined to merge with a new one&mdash;a story that was just beginning, carried by immigrants arriving from the heart of Europe.</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h4 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Historical Context: Life in the 19th-Century Midwest</span></h4><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">When the Wood family arrived in the Midwest, they entered a region undergoing explosive growth. Cities like Chicago were magnets for both native-born Americans and European immigrants, all drawn by the promise of jobs in factories, stockyards, and on the railroads. The landscape was a dynamic mix of established farms and rapidly growing industrial towns. For settlers in Wisconsin, life was defined by the rhythms of agriculture and the burgeoning industries of lumber, brewing, and manufacturing. The state&#39;s towns, particularly those along the shores of Lake Michigan like Manitowoc and Two Rivers, were becoming diverse communities, with large populations of German, Scandinavian, and, increasingly, Bohemian immigrants creating a rich cultural tapestry.</span><span class="c6 c18">6</span></p><hr><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c6 c18"></span></p><h2 class="c22"><span class="c27 c7">Part III: The New England Planters and Quabbin Valley Heritage</span></h2><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Chapter 5: New England Planters: The Freeman and Harlow Migration to Nova Scotia</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">Beyond the direct line of descent that pushed westward, the broader Wood family tree contains branches that embarked on their own unique pioneering journeys. One of the most compelling of these side stories is the family&#39;s participation in the New England Planters movement&mdash;a significant but often overlooked chapter in North American colonial history.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The story begins in the aftermath of the French and Indian War (1754-1763). In 1755, the British colonial government of Nova Scotia made the brutal decision to forcibly deport thousands of French-speaking Catholic settlers, known as Acadians, from their fertile farmlands.</span><span class="c6">8</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;With these lands now vacant, Governor Charles Lawrence sought to repopulate the region with loyal, Protestant, English-speaking subjects. He issued proclamations in 1758 and 1759, which were widely circulated in the New England colonies, offering free land grants to entice settlers to move north.</span><span class="c6">9</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Land was becoming increasingly scarce in the crowded towns of Massachusetts and Connecticut, making the offer of rich, pre-cleared Acadian farmland incredibly attractive.</span><span class="c6 c18">10</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Among the approximately 8,000 New Englanders who answered this call were members of the extended Wood family.</span><span class="c6">8</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Patience Wood (born 1729), the sister of direct ancestor Jabez Wood Jr., had married a man named Simeon Freeman.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;In 1761, Patience, Simeon, and their young children packed their belongings and sailed from Massachusetts to Nova Scotia. They received a land grant and settled in or near the newly established township of Liverpool on Nova Scotia&#39;s South Shore.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Their journey represents the first major migration of English-speaking people within North America.</span><span class="c6">8</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Like their Pilgrim ancestors, they faced the immense challenges of establishing a new community on a rugged frontier. They were &quot;planters&quot;&mdash;an Elizabethan term for colonists&mdash;tasked with building towns, farms, and a new society loyal to the British Crown.</span><span class="c6">8</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;The Freeman family became part of a transplanted New England community. Their son, Samuel Freeman, later married Rebecca Harlow, the daughter of another Planter family, cementing their roots in this new northern home.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;While this branch of the family is collateral to the main Konecny lineage, their story is a powerful testament to the adventurous, pioneering spirit that characterized the entire Wood clan, a spirit that continually sought new horizons, whether in the Canadian Maritimes or the American Midwest.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c18">12</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c6 c18"></span></p><h4 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Historical Context: The New England Planters (1759-1768)</span></h4><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The New England Planters were a distinct group of approximately 2,000 families who migrated from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island to Nova Scotia between 1759 and 1768.</span><span class="c6">11</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;They were largely farmers and fishermen, attracted by the promise of free land vacated by the expelled Acadians. They established townships with familiar New England names like Horton, Cornwallis, and Falmouth, bringing with them their Congregationalist faith and traditions of self-governance through town meetings.</span><span class="c6">10</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Their arrival fundamentally reshaped the demographic and cultural landscape of Nova Scotia, establishing a strong English-speaking, Protestant presence that laid the foundation for many of the province&#39;s modern communities. Their descendants include two Canadian Prime Ministers, Sir Charles Tupper and Sir Robert Borden, highlighting the lasting impact of this pivotal migration.</span><span class="c6 c18">13</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c6 c18"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Chapter 6: Quabbin Valley Roots: Settling and Losing the Swift River Towns</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Deep within the family&#39;s New England heritage lies a story of both creation and loss, a narrative tied to a beautiful valley in western Massachusetts that now exists only in memory. A notation on the original handwritten family tree states that some Wood ancestors were &quot;original proprietors of the Quabbin, Mass. area,&quot; a tantalizing clue to a profound and poignant chapter in the family&#39;s history.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">This note refers to the generation of Jabez Wood Jr. (born 1720) and his wife, Joanna Short.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;In the 1730s and 1740s, they were among the first waves of European settlers to receive land grants in the Swift River Valley. This area, which included the towns of Greenwich, Dana, Enfield, and Prescott, was a thriving agricultural region.</span><span class="c6">14</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;As &quot;proprietors,&quot; these early settlers were the foundational landowners, tasked with clearing the forest, establishing farms, and building the communities that would flourish there for nearly two centuries. A historical record from Prescott confirms the presence of a Samuel Wood as a landowner in the valley, providing a direct link between the family and this lost landscape.</span><span class="c6 c18">16</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">For two hundred years, the valley prospered. But in the early 20th century, the rapidly growing city of Boston faced a severe water crisis. In a monumental feat of engineering and an act of profound sacrifice, the Massachusetts legislature passed the Swift River Act in 1927, authorizing the damming of the river and the flooding of the entire valley to create a massive reservoir.</span><span class="c6 c18">17</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The human cost was immense. The four towns of Dana, Enfield, Greenwich, and Prescott were officially disincorporated on April 28, 1938.</span><span class="c6">19</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Over the course of a decade, 2,500 residents were forced to relocate.</span><span class="c6">17</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Their homes, schools, churches, and mills were razed or burned to the ground. In an especially somber task, the bodies of 7,600 deceased residents were exhumed from 34 local cemeteries and reinterred at the newly created Quabbin Park Cemetery.</span><span class="c6">18</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;On August 14, 1939, the valves were closed, and the waters of the Swift River began to rise, slowly submerging the landscape that the Wood family&#39;s ancestors had pioneered.</span><span class="c6 c18">22</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Today, the Quabbin Reservoir is a place of serene, man-made beauty, the primary water source for millions of people.</span><span class="c6">23</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;But beneath its surface lie the foundations, stone walls, and memories of a lost world. The family&#39;s connection to this place is a powerful reminder that history is not just a story of progress, but also of loss. The ancestral lands of the Wood family were sacrificed for the public good, their legacy submerged but not forgotten, preserved in the family tree and in the silent, watery heart of Massachusetts.</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h4 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Historical Context: The Drowning of Four Towns (1927-1939)</span></h4><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The creation of the Quabbin Reservoir was one of the most ambitious public works projects in American history.

Land was scarce, taxes were high, and opportunities were limited under the rule of the Habsburgs. For many, the promise of America&mdash;of land, jobs, and freedom&mdash;was an irresistible lure.</span><span class="c6">24</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This period saw a great wave of Czech migration to the United States, with many drawn to the American Midwest, where the climate and farmland were reminiscent of their homeland.</span><span class="c6 c18">7</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Among those who made the arduous journey were Christopher Konecny&#39;s great-grandparents, Peter Konecny and Anna Tauber.</span><span class="c6">27</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;They were part of a crucial evolution in the Czech immigrant experience. While the first wave of Bohemians to Wisconsin in the 1850s and 1860s were primarily farmers seeking to establish new homesteads, the later wave, of which the Konecnys were a part, was increasingly drawn to the industrial towns.</span><span class="c6">24</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;They were not pioneers seeking to tame the prairie, but laborers seeking work in the foundries, mills, and factories that were powering the Midwest&#39;s growth.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Their journey likely began with an overland trip to a major European port like Bremen or Hamburg, followed by a crowded passage in steerage across the Atlantic. Upon arriving in America, they made their way to Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, a region that had become a major center of Czech settlement.</span><span class="c6">6</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;By 1900, the county was home to over 1,600 native-born Bohemians who had established a vibrant community with their own churches, social halls, and businesses.</span><span class="c6">6</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Peter Konecny found work as a welder, a skilled trade that placed him squarely in the industrial economy of the era.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">For the Konecny family, however, the promise of the New World was soon met with devastating tragedy. Sometime after the birth of their son, Frank J. Konecny, in 1924, Peter was killed in a workplace accident.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This catastrophic event left Anna a widow in a new country and their young son, Frank, effectively on his own by the age of 11.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;Frank&#39;s childhood was one of immense hardship, forcing him to develop a resilience and self-reliance that would define his character for the rest of his life. His story is a poignant testament to the perils faced by immigrant industrial workers and the incredible fortitude required to overcome such profound loss. Despite this tragic start, the Konecny family had planted its roots in American soil, bringing a proud Czech heritage that would endure and, in time, merge with a lineage stretching back to the</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c13">Mayflower</span><span class="c5 c7">.</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h4 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Side Story: Bohemian Heartland</span></h4><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Life in 19th-century Bohemia was a rich tapestry of culture, tradition, and faith, deeply rooted in the agricultural rhythms of the land. For centuries, the Czech people had maintained their unique Slavic language and customs despite being under the rule of the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy. Daily life revolved around the village, the church, and the family. Folk traditions were strong, expressed through music, colorful embroidered costumes (</span><span class="c13">kroje</span><span class="c5">), and festive celebrations. The cuisine was hearty, featuring dumplings (</span><span class="c13">knedl&iacute;ky</span><span class="c5">), roasted meats, and pastries like </span><span class="c13">kol&aacute;&#269;e</span><span class="c5 c7">. While most were devoutly Roman Catholic, a strong undercurrent of national pride, harkening back to the 15th-century reformer Jan Hus, persisted. It was this deep-seated cultural identity and resilience that immigrants like the Konecnys carried with them to America.</span></p><hr><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h2 class="c22"><span class="c7 c27">Part V: Union of Colonial and Immigrant Lines</span></h2><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Chapter 8: A 1947 Union: Marjorie Wood and Frank Konecny&#39;s Marriage</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">In the optimistic, forward-looking years following the Second World War, the two great streams of the family&#39;s history&mdash;one flowing for over three centuries from Plymouth Rock, the other for a half-century from the heart of Bohemia&mdash;finally converged on the shores of Lake Michigan. The marriage of Marjorie Mae Wood and Frank J. Konecny in 1947 was more than the union of two people; it was the symbolic joining of two quintessential American narratives.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Marjorie Wood, born in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1925, was the inheritor of the family&#39;s deep colonial legacy.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;As the daughter of Colonel Norman B. Wood, a distinguished Army officer who had served with valor in both World Wars, she was raised with a strong sense of history and civic duty.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;She was well-educated, a journalism major at the University of Wisconsin who went on to work as a society page editor, a role in which she once interviewed the actor Charlton Heston after his Oscar win.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;Her lineage was a direct thread back to the Pilgrims, the patriots, and the pioneers who had built the nation.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Frank Konecny&#39;s path to that day was starkly different. Born in Manitowoc in 1924, he was the son of recent immigrants, his life forged by hardship and resilience.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Having lost his father at a young age, he learned self-reliance early. Like so many of his generation, he answered the nation&#39;s call during World War II, serving as a Navy sailor in the South Pacific theater.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;He returned from the war a hardworking, determined man, ready to build a life in the manufacturing industries of his hometown. His was the story of the immigrant&#39;s son, driven to succeed and prove his place in his new homeland.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">Sometime in the mid-1940s, in the community of Two Rivers, Wisconsin, where Marjorie&#39;s family had settled and Frank lived, their two worlds met. Their courtship and subsequent marriage in 1947 represented a perfect microcosm of the American &quot;melting pot.&quot; In their union, the centuries-old Yankee heritage embodied by Marjorie blended with the fresh, striving immigrant spirit exemplified by Frank. Their wedding was the moment the two halves of this family history became a single, unified whole, creating a new legacy to be passed on to their children and all the generations to follow.</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h4 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Historical Context: America in 1947</span></h4><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">The year 1947 found the United States standing as a global superpower, emerging from the crucible of World War II with confidence and unprecedented prosperity. The G.I. Bill was sending millions of veterans like Frank Konecny to college or helping them secure home loans, fueling the growth of suburbs and a booming middle class. The nation was on the cusp of the &quot;Baby Boom,&quot; a period of optimism where families grew and the American Dream seemed within reach for millions. It was an era of economic expansion, technological innovation, and cultural dynamism, a hopeful moment in which a young couple like Frank and Marjorie could build a family and a future, embodying the promise of post-war America.</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Chapter 9: Merging Legacies: Two Rivers, Wisconsin as the Melting Pot</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">After their wedding, Frank and Marjorie Konecny established their home in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, a community that would become the heart of the newly merged family for the next half-century. Their life together was a testament to the post-war American ideals of hard work, family, and community involvement, all while nurturing a unique blend of their distinct heritages.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Frank Konecny&#39;s career was a remarkable story of dedication and upward mobility. He began working at a local tent and awning company and, over the course of 50 years, rose through the ranks to become its general manager.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;His professional life exemplified the immigrant work ethic and the opportunities available in the booming mid-century economy. Marjorie, meanwhile, balanced her professional talents with the demands of a growing family. She raised their three children&mdash;Peter, Michael, and Sandra&mdash;and later in life, she indulged her passion for travel and community service, volunteering her time and energy to local causes.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Their home became a central hub for the extended family, a place known for its warmth and hospitality. It was here that the blending of traditions truly came to life. While Marjorie was keenly aware of her Pilgrim ancestry and the deep history of the Wood family, Frank infused their gatherings with the hearty spirit of his Czech and Wisconsin roots. This cultural fusion is perfectly captured in a fond memory shared by a cousin, Virginia Wood Dagel, in the </span><span class="c13">Wood Family Reunion Book</span><span class="c5">. She recalled the large family gatherings at the Konecny house where &quot;Uncle Frank made the best brats&quot;.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;This simple, affectionate anecdote speaks volumes. The tradition of grilling bratwursts simmered in beer and onions&mdash;a quintessential Wisconsin custom popularized by German and Czech immigrants&mdash;became a beloved staple of the Wood family reunions, a sensory symbol of the merged legacies.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">As their children grew, Frank and Marjorie&#39;s world expanded. They traveled extensively, visiting Europe&mdash;including a meaningful trip to Frank&#39;s ancestral homeland of Czechoslovakia&mdash;as well as Asia and Australia.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;They passed on to their children an appreciation for both sides of their heritage, raising them with stories of Mayflower voyages and an understanding of their immigrant grandparents&#39; sacrifices.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Marjorie passed away in 1993, followed by Frank in 2006.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;By the time of their passing, the two family lines that had once been worlds apart had been fully integrated for two generations. Their life together was the crucible in which the colonial and immigrant narratives were forged into a single, strong, and enduring American family story.</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h2 class="c22"><span class="c27 c7">Part VI: 20th Century Generations</span></h2><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Chapter 10: Post-war Prosperity: The Konecny-Wood Children and the Mid-20th Century</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">The children of Frank and Marjorie Konecny grew up in the prosperous and dynamic decades of the mid-20th century. Their lives, and those of their cousins in the extended Wood family, reflect the opportunities and changes of the post-war era, including higher education, corporate careers that demanded geographic mobility, and an enduring commitment to family ties.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Peter Jan Konecny, born in 1949, is the direct link to the present generation. Like his mother, he attended the University of Wisconsin. In 1971, he married Jody Toepel, and together they embarked on a journey that took them far from their Wisconsin roots.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Peter built a successful thirty-year career with the Miller Brewing Company, a profession that perfectly suited a descendant of Wisconsin&#39;s German and Czech heritage. His work as a corporate executive led the family across the country, with moves to Syracuse, New York; Los Angeles, California; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, before they ultimately retired to Tennessee.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;This coast-to-coast journey illustrates the modern American experience of professional mobility, a stark contrast to the centuries their ancestors spent rooted in a single town.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">The lives of Peter&#39;s siblings, Michael and Sandra Konecny, and their cousins in the Taylor and Dagel branches of the Wood family, followed similar paths of education, marriage, and careers, painting a broad picture of a family fully engaged in the American middle-class story of the late 20th century.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">A particularly poignant and powerful chapter in this generation&#39;s story involves Peter and Jody&#39;s first child, Kari. Born in 1970, Kari was placed for adoption. For decades, her story was a missing piece of the family puzzle. Then, in 2017, in a joyful and emotional reunion, Kari reconnected with her birth family.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;This reunion was not just a personal milestone but a profound moment of healing and expansion for the entire family, demonstrating its capacity to grow and embrace its own complex history with love and acceptance.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Throughout these years of geographic dispersal, the family maintained its strong bonds through letters, phone calls, and, most importantly, family reunions. The Wood Family Reunions, which became a cherished tradition, served as the anchor that kept the far-flung branches of the family connected to their shared roots in Wisconsin.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c6 c18"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Chapter 11: Modern Era Milestones: Late-20th Century into the 2000s</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">As the 20th century gave way to the 21st, the Konecny-Wood family continued to grow and evolve, its branches spreading ever wider across the American landscape while its roots remained firmly planted in a shared heritage. This era is marked by the milestones of the next generation, the continuation of cherished traditions, and the powerful affirmation of family bonds at a landmark reunion.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The children of Peter, Michael, and Sandra began their own families, with marriages and the births of grandchildren expanding the family tree into its 14th and 15th generations since the arrival of the first Woods in America.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Family members established lives and careers across the country, with branches flourishing in Minnesota, North Carolina, Florida, and beyond, a testament to the family&#39;s full participation in the mobile society of modern America.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;The advent of new technologies like email and social media made it easier than ever to bridge the geographical distances, supplementing the traditional letters and phone calls that had kept previous generations connected.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The emotional centerpiece of this modern era was the 2019 Wood Family Reunion. Dozens of relatives from across the United States converged on Neshotah Beach in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, the town that had served as the family&#39;s heartland for over 70 years.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;The reunion was a vibrant celebration of their common history, a time for sharing stories, updating the family genealogy, and introducing the youngest generation to their cousins and their shared past.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The gathering was also a celebration of the traditions that bind them. The beloved &quot;Brats &amp; Beers&quot; cookout, a legacy of Uncle Frank Konecny, was a highlight of the weekend.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;The family recipe for his beer-cooked bratwursts, carefully preserved and shared in the 2019 reunion book, is more than just a set of instructions; it is a tangible link to the past, a taste of home that evokes memories of Frank himself manning the grill at countless family gatherings.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;The continuation of this tradition symbolizes the successful merging of the family&#39;s diverse cultural threads into a unique and cherished Konecny-Wood identity. The 2019 reunion was a powerful statement that even as the family spreads out, its members remain deeply connected by the bonds of kinship and a proud, shared history.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c6 c18"></span></p><h2 class="c22"><span class="c27 c7">Part VII: Present-Day Legacy and Descendants</span></h2><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Chapter 12: Entering the 21st Century: The Family Today</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">The long and winding historical narrative of the Konecny family culminates in the present, in the lives of the 15th generation of American descendants. Their stories, careers, and families are the living embodiment of the legacy forged by centuries of pioneers, patriots, and immigrants. As a representative of this generation, the story of Christopher Peter Konecny brings the family&#39;s journey into the 21st century.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Born in 1979 in Syracuse, New York, Christopher&#39;s childhood reflected the mobility of his parents&#39; generation, with moves to California and Georgia.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;He pursued higher education at the University of Georgia, earning both a Bachelor&#39;s and a Master&#39;s degree, and has built a successful career in IT consulting, now serving as a Managing Director at KPMG in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 2005, he married Jessica (JC) Morris, and they are the proud parents of two daughters, Greta (born 2008) and Sofia (born 2010).</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;Christopher&#39;s life story exemplifies the opportunities made possible by the sacrifices and determination of the generations that came before him&mdash;a journey from the shores of Plymouth and the villages of Bohemia to a thriving, modern American life.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">His siblings share in this legacy. His sisters, Lisa Konecny Youmans and Kathryn Konecny Chavez, have built their own families and successful careers in fields like engineering and nursing.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5 c7">&nbsp;Their lives, along with those of their many cousins, showcase the diversity and continuity of the family today.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">The most powerful chapter of the modern family story is that of their eldest sibling, Kari (Baumann) Haege. Reunited with the family in 2017 after being placed for adoption decades earlier, Kari has become an integral and cherished part of the Konecny clan.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Her own large and loving family, which includes five biological and three adopted children, has enriched the family tapestry immeasurably.

It is a narrative woven from the courage of Pilgrims who faced an unknown world for their faith, the determination of pioneers who carved a nation from the wilderness, the resilience of immigrants who crossed an ocean in search of a better life, and the unity that comes from blending diverse backgrounds into a single family.</span><span class="c6">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;The Konecny family&#39;s history is a microcosm of the nation&#39;s own story of migration, perseverance, reinvention, and the enduring power of hope.</span><span class="c6 c18">1</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">To know this history is to understand the deep roots that nourish the present.

This volume is not an end, but a milestone. It is a foundation upon which future generations can build. The family&#39;s history will continue to be enriched by ongoing genealogical research, the digitization of records, and the insights revealed by modern DNA testing. The &quot;Mysteries &amp; Research Opportunities&quot; section of this book serves as a roadmap for future family historians, inviting them to take up the torch and uncover the next chapter of the story.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">Ultimately, the most important way to keep this history alive is to share it. The family reunions must continue. The traditions, like Uncle Frank&#39;s beer brats, must be passed down. The stories of ancestors, both famous and humble, must be told and retold, so that the youngest members of the family understand that they are part of something vast, enduring, and meaningful.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">This book is a tribute to every ancestor who dared to dream, to build, and to persevere. It is an expression of gratitude for the legacy they created and a charge to the living to honor that legacy by keeping their stories alive.

Let the brats simmer gently in the beer bath for at least 20 minutes, or up to an hour, to allow them to cook through and absorb the flavor. Do not boil, as this can cause the casings to split.</span></li><li class="c3 c24 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c7">Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for medium heat.</span></li><li class="c3 c24 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c7">Remove the brats from the beer bath and place them on the hot grill. Grill for 5-10 minutes, turning frequently, until they are browned and have nice grill marks.</span></li><li class="c3 c24 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c7">While the brats are grilling, keep the onions and beer warm on the stove.</span></li><li class="c3 c24 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c7">Serve the grilled brats on buns, generously topped with the beer-soaked onions.

By analyzing the DNA of living descendants, we can confirm paper-trail connections, break through brick walls, and uncover the deep ancestral origins of the family.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">This family&#39;s unique genetic tapestry is expected to reflect its dual heritage. Autosomal DNA tests (such as those from AncestryDNA or 23andMe) taken by descendants of Frank and Marjorie Konecny would likely show a blend of Northwestern European (English, Scottish) and Eastern European (Bohemian/Czech) ancestry. These tests can also connect family members to thousands of distant cousins, some of whom may hold missing pieces of the family puzzle, such as old photographs or family Bibles.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">Future research could involve more specialized tests. A Y-DNA test, passed down from father to son, could be taken by a male-line Konecny descendant to trace the paternal line deep into its European past, potentially identifying a specific region or even village of origin in the Czech Republic. Similarly, an mtDNA test, which traces the direct maternal line, could follow the lineage of Marjorie Wood&#39;s mother back through generations of colonial women. As more family members participate in genetic testing, a richer and more detailed picture of the Konecny family&#39;s genetic heritage will emerge, adding a new scientific dimension to this historical saga.</span></p><hr><p class="c19 c17"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p><h2 class="c22"><span class="c27 c7">Appendices</span></h2><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c27 c7"></span></p><h3 class="c22"><span class="c14 c7">Appendix I: Full Genealogical Charts and Tables</span></h3><p class="c8 c17"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c7">The following tables provide a comprehensive, data-driven overview of the direct ancestral lines detailed in this book.
