  <h1>The Konecny Family: From the Mayflower to the Midwest</h1>

  <p><em>A Rich and Storied Heritage.</em> The story of a family is the story of a nation in miniature – a chronicle of migration, faith, hardship, and love written across generations. The history of the Konecny family is a profound example of this, tracing a remarkable journey across four centuries of American life:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. This narrative, built upon dedicated family research, connects the 21st-century life of Christopher Peter Konecny to the very bedrock of American history – the deck of the Mayflower:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.</p>

  <p>This family’s saga is a tapestry woven from several distinct yet interconnected threads:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. It begins with the Konecny family, part of the great wave of Central European immigration that helped build modern America, settling in the industrious communities of Wisconsin:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. It follows the Wood family, whose journey took them from colonial Massachusetts to the heart of the Midwest, where they became pillars of their community in Two Rivers, Wisconsin:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. It explores the experiences of the Freeman and Harlow families, who participated in the significant 18th-century “New England Planter” migration to Nova Scotia – a state-sponsored effort to resettle lands left vacant after the expulsion of the Acadians:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. Finally, it anchors the entire maternal lineage in two of the most significant figures in American colonial history: Mayflower Pilgrims <strong>John Howland</strong> and <strong>Elizabeth Tilley</strong>:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.</p>

  <p>The union of these lineages through the marriage of <strong>Marjorie Wood</strong> and <strong>Frank Konecny</strong> in the 20th century represents the merging of two quintessential American narratives:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. One is the story of 19th- and 20th-century immigration – a tale of leaving an old world for a new one, of adaptation, struggle, and enterprise. The other is the story of the nation’s founding – of colonial expansion, religious conviction, and the pioneering spirit that pushed frontiers ever outward:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. To provide a clear guide to this remarkable lineage, the direct ancestral path from Christopher Peter Konecny to his Mayflower forebears is outlined below:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.</p>

  <h2>The Konecny Family: From Bohemia to Wisconsin</h2>
  <p>The Konecny family’s story in America begins with its roots in Central Europe:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. The surname itself offers a clue to this past: “Konecny” (from the Czech/Slovak <em>konečný</em>) means “final” or “ultimate,” perhaps originally used for a family living at the end of a village or for a youngest son:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. This name was carried across the Atlantic by Frank Konecny’s parents, who emigrated from Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) and settled in Manitowoc, Wisconsin:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.</p>

  <p>Frank Konecny’s childhood in Wisconsin was marked by hardship. His father worked as a welder, but tragedy struck when he was killed in a work accident, leaving young Frank on his own at the age of eleven:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. Frank’s mother, not fluent in English, was unable to support the family, forcing Frank to find his own way at a very young age:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. Despite this disadvantaged start, Frank grew into a resilient and hardworking man. He served his country with the U.S. Navy in the South Pacific during World War II and, upon returning home, built a stable life and career:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. In fact, he worked for 50 years at the same company in Wisconsin – beginning as a tent and awning maker and steadily working his way up to the position of general manager:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.</p>

  <h2>A Union of Old and New Worlds</h2>
  <p>In 1947, <strong>Frank Konecny</strong> married <strong>Marjorie Wood</strong> of Two Rivers, Wisconsin – a union that stands as a pivotal moment where two long, distinct streams of the American experience converged:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. Marjorie, born in Madison, Wisconsin in 1925, was a descendant of some of the nation’s earliest English colonists, while Frank was the son of recent Bohemian immigrants seeking opportunity in America’s heartland:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. Their marriage was a microcosm of the great American “melting pot,” blending a deep Colonial New England heritage with a proud Central European immigrant legacy:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.</p>

  <p>Marjorie Wood was a talented, educated woman. She attended the University of Wisconsin, Madison for three years as a journalism major and put those skills to use as the Society Editor for the local newspaper, where she won numerous state journalism awards:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. One highlight of Marjorie’s career was a one-on-one interview with actor Charlton Heston, conducted shortly after he won the Best Actor Oscar for <em>Ben-Hur</em>:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. Beyond her professional accomplishments, Marjorie was a dedicated mother and community volunteer. Frank and Marjorie raised three children – Peter, Michael, and Sandra – and built a life full of close friends. After their children were grown, the couple traveled the world together, visiting Czechoslovakia (reconnecting with Frank’s roots), as well as Asia, Europe, and Australia:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. Marjorie passed away in 1993, and Frank followed in 2006, leaving behind a rich legacy of family and heritage:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}.</p>

  <h2>The Wood Family of Massachusetts and Wisconsin</h2>
  <p>The story of the Wood family’s modern era is centered in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, and begins with Marjorie’s father, <strong>Colonel Norman Bentley Wood</strong>. Born in Richfield, New Jersey in 1889, Norman’s family moved to Marshfield, Wisconsin during his youth, and then to Chicago in 1905, where he finished high school:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. In 1909, Norman enlisted as a private in the Illinois National Guard, marking the start of a long and distinguished military career. He served in the 1916 Mexican Border Campaign and entered World War I as a Captain of Infantry, fighting in six major campaigns in Europe:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}. By the end of World War I, Norman had proven himself a capable leader.</p>

  <p>Norman Wood’s personal life took a fateful turn in 1914 when, at a dance in Chicago, he met <strong>Mae Chill</strong>, a Chicago native born in 1891:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. Norman proposed a year later, but Mae agreed to marry him only on one condition: that he give up the National Guard:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}. Norman agreed, and they wed in Chicago in 1915. Their wedding day even had a touch of adventure – unable to find a cab, the bride was brought to the church by a man with a banana wagon, for a fee of one dollar:contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}.</p>

  <p>Although Norman promised to leave the Guard, it was a promise he could not keep for long. After World War I, he remained in the Army Reserves. The growing Wood family moved frequently with his assignments: Rockford, Illinois (where son Franklin was born in 1921), then Danville, Illinois (daughter Virginia, 1922), and by 1924 they settled in Madison, Wisconsin, where Marjorie (1925) and Katherine (1927) were born:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}. In 1930, Norman transitioned to civilian work and relocated the family to Two Rivers, Wisconsin. There he became General Manager of the Metal Ware Corporation, and later a sales representative for the Hamilton Manufacturing Company:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}. Two Rivers would remain the family’s home for decades to come.</p>

  <p>With the outbreak of World War II, Norman’s military expertise was again called upon. He was promoted to Colonel and returned to active duty in 1941:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}. During WWII he served on 17 Pacific islands, earning a Silver Star for heroism, as well as the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}. After 34 years of service, Colonel Norman Bentley Wood retired in 1949. He was not only a decorated officer but also a beloved father and a sought-after public speaker in his community. Norman passed away suddenly in 1950 at age 60:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}. His wife Mae continued to be the family’s matriarch in Two Rivers until her own passing in 1984 at the age of 93:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}.</p>

  <h3>Colonial Roots in New England</h3>
  <p>Tracing the Wood family line backward from Colonel Norman Wood reveals deep roots in colonial America. Norman’s parents were George S. Wood and Mary Wagner Bentley; his grandparents were Franklin Wood and Sarah Eliza Barber; his great-grandparents were Samuel Wood and Abigail Church; his 2× great-grandparents were Philip Wood and Eunice Pierce; and his 3× great-grandparents were Jabez Wood Jr. and Joanna Short:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}. This lineage leads directly back to the heart of colonial Massachusetts:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}.</p>

  <p>The Wood family’s connection to the land in Massachusetts was profound and storied. According to an old hand-drawn family chart, Norman’s ancestors were among the “original proprietors” of the Quabbin area in Massachusetts:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}. This refers to a dramatic chapter in Massachusetts history: in the 1920s, to solve Boston’s water shortage, the state dammed the Swift River and created the Quabbin Reservoir, permanently flooding four entire towns (Dana, Enfield, Greenwich, and Prescott) and displacing all their residents:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}. Over 7,500 graves were also relocated from abandoned cemeteries:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}. If the Wood ancestors were indeed original proprietors of that region, it means they were among the first European settlers of those towns – a legacy ultimately submerged under water by the needs of a modern metropolis:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}.</p>

  <p>The direct Wood line stretches back to 17th-century Plymouth Colony. The progenitor was <strong>Henry Wood</strong>, born in England by 1620 and recorded in Plymouth by 1641:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}. In 1644, Henry married <strong>Abigail Jenney</strong>, daughter of prominent Plymouth colonists John and Sarah Jenney:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}. Henry Wood became an active citizen in the developing town of Middleborough, Massachusetts, acquiring land and serving on local juries:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}. Henry’s son <strong>David Wood</strong> (b.1651) married Mary Barker (the widowed Pratt and Coombs) in 1685:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}; David and Mary were the parents of <strong>Jabez Wood Sr.</strong> (b.1691), who carries the Wood line forward:contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45}. Jabez Wood Sr. eventually married <strong>Hannah Nelson</strong> – and through that marriage, the Wood family became linked to the Mayflower lineage, as we will see.</p>

  <h3>Journeys Beyond Massachusetts: The Nova Scotia Planters</h3>
  <p>The Wood family story is not confined to Massachusetts alone. One branch of the family participated in an often overlooked chapter of colonial history – the New England Planters’ migration to Nova Scotia. <strong>Patience Wood</strong> (born 1729), a daughter of Jabez Wood Sr. and sister of direct ancestor Jabez Wood Jr., married <strong>Simeon Freeman</strong> in Middleborough in 1756:contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}. Around 1761, Simeon and Patience Freeman, along with their young children, joined a major resettlement movement of roughly 8,000 New Englanders to “New Scotland” (Nova Scotia):contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}. This migration was encouraged by the British colonial authorities, who offered free land grants to loyal Protestant settlers after brutally expelling the French Acadian population in 1755:contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}. The Freeman family took up land in the newly founded township of Liverpool, Nova Scotia – a community built almost entirely by these New England Planters:contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}.</p>

  <p>In Nova Scotia, the Freemans prospered and intermarried with other planter families. Simeon and Patience’s son, <strong>Samuel Freeman</strong>, later married <strong>Rebecca Harlow</strong>, the daughter of another Planter family:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}. This union of the Freeman and Harlow families exemplified the tight-knit community formed by the New England transplants in their new home:contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}. Though this Nova Scotia branch is a collateral line (Patience was a sibling of the direct Wood ancestor), it remains an integral part of the family’s rich tapestry – illustrating how one limb of the family tree ventured north to Canada and helped establish new towns, while the main trunk of the family eventually moved westward to the American Midwest.</p>

  <h2>The Mayflower Legacy</h2>
  <p>The deepest roots of the family in America trace back to two passengers of the Mayflower: <strong>John Howland</strong> and <strong>Elizabeth Tilley</strong>. John Howland came to America as an indentured servant to Governor John Carver and famously fell overboard during a storm on the Mayflower’s voyage – but miraculously managed to grab a rope and be hauled back to safety:contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}. Elizabeth Tilley was just 13 years old on the Mayflower, traveling with her parents, who (like roughly half the colonists) perished during the first harsh winter in Plymouth. Orphaned in a new world, Elizabeth likely found a home with the Carver family until she came of age:contentReference[oaicite:53]{index=53}.</p>

  <p>Around 1623, John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley were married in Plymouth:contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54}. Their union was truly foundational for the colony’s future. Remarkably, John and Elizabeth went on to have ten children, all of whom survived to adulthood and married:contentReference[oaicite:55]{index=55}. Because of this large progeny, John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley are believed to have more living descendants today than any other Mayflower passengers – a list that notably includes U.S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush:contentReference[oaicite:56]{index=56}.</p>

  <p>The Konecny family’s direct connection to these Mayflower pioneers comes through their descendants in subsequent generations. John and Elizabeth’s third child, <strong>Hope Howland</strong>, was born in Plymouth in 1629:contentReference[oaicite:57]{index=57}. Around 1646, Hope Howland married <strong>John Chipman</strong>, who became a respected ruling elder of the church in Barnstable, Massachusetts:contentReference[oaicite:58]{index=58}. Hope and John Chipman had twelve children, establishing the Chipman family firmly in the New England colonies:contentReference[oaicite:59]{index=59}. Their daughter <strong>Hannah Chipman</strong> (born 1658) married <strong>Thomas Huckins</strong> of Barnstable in 1680:contentReference[oaicite:60]{index=60}. Thomas and Hannah Huckins’s daughter, <strong>Hope Huckins</strong>, later married <strong>Thomas Nelson</strong> – and this marriage is the crucial link that connects the Wood family line to the Mayflower descendants:contentReference[oaicite:61]{index=61}. Thomas and Hope Nelson’s daughter, <strong>Hannah Nelson</strong> (born 1699), grew up in Plymouth County.</p>

  <p>In 1719, Hannah Nelson married <strong>Jabez Wood Sr.</strong> in Middleborough, Massachusetts:contentReference[oaicite:62]{index=62}. This marriage united the two lineages: the Wood family (descended from early settler Henry Wood of Middleborough) and the Nelson/Huckins/Chipman line (descended from John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley of the Mayflower). With the marriage of Hannah Nelson and Jabez Wood Sr., a journey of eleven generations from the Mayflower’s landing in 1620 to the heart of the Wood family in the 18th century was completed:contentReference[oaicite:63]{index=63}. Every generation from John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley down to Hannah Nelson had carried the legacy forward, and through her marriage into the Wood family, that legacy entered the direct ancestral line that would lead, many years later, to Marjorie Wood – and thus to the present-day Konecny family.</p>

  <h2>The Konecny Family Today</h2>
  <p>The Konecny-Wood marriage produced three children, and through their eldest, the family line continues into the present day. Frank and Marjorie’s first child, <strong>Peter Jan Konecny</strong>, was born in Two Rivers, Wisconsin in 1949. Peter grew up to graduate from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and in 1971 he married <strong>Jody Toepel</strong>. Peter’s career with the Miller Brewing Company took the family on a journey of its own: over the years, they lived in Syracuse (New York), Los Angeles (California), Cincinnati (Ohio), and Milwaukee (Wisconsin), before Peter and Jody eventually retired to Sparta, Tennessee. This peripatetic career gave the family a taste of life in many parts of the country.</p>

  <p>Peter and Jody Konecny raised four children. Their first, a daughter named <strong>Kari</strong>, was born in 1970 and was placed for adoption – but decades later, in 2017, the family was joyfully reunited with her. Their other children are <strong>Christopher</strong> (born 1979), <strong>Lisa</strong> (born 1980), and <strong>Kathryn</strong> (born 1983):contentReference[oaicite:69]{index=69}. Today, the Konecny siblings remain close, having bridged that early separation with Kari. </p>

  <p><strong>Christopher Konecny</strong>, the second child of Peter and Jody, is the direct line descendant through which this family history has been traced. Christopher was born in Syracuse, New York in 1979. During his childhood, he moved with his family to Los Angeles, and then at age 11 to Albany, Georgia, where he lived through his high school years. Christopher went on to attend the University of Georgia, earning both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Information Technology. In 2002, soon after finishing graduate school, he accepted a position with the global consulting firm KPMG in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he still works today as a Managing Consulting Director. In 2005, Christopher married <strong>Jessica “JC” Morris</strong>, and together they have two daughters: <strong>Greta</strong>, born in 2008, and <strong>Sofia</strong>, born in 2010. The family resides in the Charlotte area, carrying forward the Konecny family legacy into the 21st century.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:2em;">A Tapestry of American History</h2>
  <p>The journey of the Konecny family, from the Mayflower to the Midwest, is a vibrant tapestry woven with the threads of American history. It begins with the courage and faith of the Mayflower Pilgrims, who risked everything for a new life and laid the foundations of a new nation. It continues through the resilience of colonial farmers like the Woods of Middleborough, who carved out a life from the New England soil, and through the adventurous spirit of families like the Freemans and Harlows, who heeded the call to settle new frontiers in Nova Scotia. The story comes full circle with the arrival of Frank Konecny’s parents in Wisconsin, joining the great tide of 19th-century European immigration that helped reshape America, and with the Wood family’s role in the great westward expansion to the Midwest.</p>

  <p>In many ways, this family’s history is a map of America, charting a course through some of its most significant epochs. From the signing of the Mayflower Compact in 1620, to the colonial settlements of Massachusetts, to the Revolutionary War and pioneer migrations, to the industrial growth of the Great Lakes region – the Konecny family’s heritage encompasses the full sweep of the American story. It is a rich and deeply American legacy of faith and perseverance, migration and adaptation, sacrifice and renewal. Each generation, in its own time, reinvented what it meant to be part of this family and this nation. And as new generations carry the story onward, the tapestry continues to grow, ever more colorful and strong, connecting the “Mayflower to the Midwest” with unbreakable threads.</p>
