# Outline for From the Mayflower to the Midwest: A Konecny Family History
## 1. Executive Summary
Overview: A museum-quality chronicle of the Konecny family’s journey across four centuries of American history – from early Pilgrim settlers to Bohemian immigrants, culminating in the present-day life of Christopher Peter Konecny. This section provides a high-level narrative that ties the family’s story to broader historical themes of migration, nation-building, and cultural heritage. It highlights how Christopher’s lineage connects to Mayflower Pilgrims John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley, early New England pioneers, Revolutionary-era patriots, New England Planters in Nova Scotia, and 19th-century Czech immigrants.
Sources & Scope: Introduces the primary sources and research basis for the book. It explains that the content synthesizes family-authored narratives (“From the Mayflower to the Midwest” research document), the Wood Family Reunion Book (2019), and the authoritative scanned handwritten family tree. It notes that where discrepancies arose, the original family tree was treated as authoritative, with corrections or open questions flagged for further research. The Executive Summary assures readers of the rigorous genealogical methods used and sets expectations for a richly illustrated, story-driven presentation.
Highlights: Summarizes key family milestones: the Mayflower legacy (foundational Pilgrim ancestors), the family’s role in colonial New England, participation in the Revolutionary War, ties to the New England Planters saga in Nova Scotia, the Quabbin Valley settlers whose lands were later lost to the Quabbin Reservoir, the Bohemian (Czech) immigrants who arrived in Wisconsin in the late 19th century, and the eventual union of these lineages through a 20th-century marriage in Wisconsin. It emphasizes the theme of two great American narratives – the Pilgrim/colonial story and the immigrant story – coming together.
Significance: Frames the family’s story as an American microcosm – illustrating perseverance, adventure, and the blending of cultures. It notes that many family members served in nation-shaping roles (from early colonial community leaders to modern military service) and that the family’s legacy is interwoven with major events in U.S. history. The summary concludes with the notion that this book is both a tribute to the Konecny family and a tangible piece of American heritage, inviting readers to explore how one family’s past reflects the broader national story.

## 3. Chronological Chapters Grouped by Thematic Parts
### Part I: Early Colonial Ancestors and the Mayflower Line
Focus: Establishes the family’s 17th-century beginnings in America. This part covers the Mayflower Pilgrims and the first generations of the Wood family in New England. It draws on colonial-era records and the family tree to show how the lineage traces back to Plymouth Colony. Primary source references (Mayflower passenger lists, Plymouth town records) will be used to enrich the narrative, corroborating details from the family’s documents.
Chapter 1 – Pilgrim Origins: The Howland-Tilley Mayflower Legacy
Content: Tells the story of John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley, the 11th great-grandparents of Christopher Konecny. Describes their voyage on the Mayflower in 1620, survival through the first winter, and their marriage around 1623. Includes the dramatic anecdote of Howland falling overboard and being rescued, and Elizabeth’s experience as an orphan in the new world. Details their ten children and emphasizes that all children survived and married, seeding a vast descendant network. Mentions that among their multitude of descendants are notable Americans such as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and George H.W. & George W. Bush – an interesting sidebar on the far-reaching legacy of this Pilgrim couple.
Sources & Notes: Based on the family’s documented lineage and established Mayflower Society research. Primary sources include the Mayflower ship’s records and Bradford’s journal (for context), while secondary sources include the Wood family genealogy notes confirming the Howland-Tilley descent. The handwritten family tree is referenced to confirm the generational links down to the Wood line. Any discrepancies between the family tree and published Mayflower genealogies are resolved with citations or flagged for verification.
Design: Features a [PHOTO PLACEHOLDER] for a reproduction of the Mayflower Compact or a painting of the Mayflower in harbor. A Historical Context breakout box might explain “Life in Plymouth Colony” – detailing what daily life was like for Pilgrims, to set the scene. A Notable Descendants sidebar could list a few famous Howland descendants (as noted above). Genealogical diagramming will show Howland and Tilley at the top, highlighting their place in the family tree.
Chapter 2 – Planting Roots in Plymouth Colony: The Wood Family Emerges
Content: Introduces Henry Wood, the progenitor of the Wood family in America, who arrived in Plymouth Colony by 1641. Chronicles Henry’s marriage in 1644 to Abigail Jenney (daughter of Pilgrim John Jenney), establishing the Wood family line in Middleborough, Massachusetts. Describes Henry Wood’s role in colonial society (land ownership, serving on juries) and traces the next couple of generations (Henry’s son David Wood, and grandson Jabez Wood Sr.) in early New England. This chapter shows how the Mayflower lineage converged with the Wood family line: notably, Jabez Wood Sr. (b. 1691) married Hannah Nelson, who was a great-granddaughter of the Howland-Tilley line. This marriage is highlighted as the point where the Pilgrim bloodline entered the Wood family’s direct ancestry.
It also recounts any early colonial intrigues noted on the family tree – for example, resolving the “key question” from the original chart about David Wood’s wife: genealogical research shows David married Mary Barker (Pratt Coombs) in 1685, explaining her multiple surnames (widowed twice before). Such details underscore the use of primary records (marriage registries, church records) to clarify family mysteries. Colonial life hardships (Indian wars, frontier challenges) can be briefly mentioned to provide context to these generations.
Sources & Notes: Draws from the Wood Family Reunion Book for the established lineage of Henry Wood’s descendants and the Mayflower to Midwest narrative which provides stories and resolved questions from the chart. Primary sources like Plymouth Colony land deeds or Middleborough town records may be cited if available (for Henry Wood’s land transactions, jury service, etc.). The handwritten tree is referenced for names and dates; its notations (e.g., “on Fortune” or “original proprietor”) are integrated into the narrative with explanations. Any ambiguous points (e.g., incomplete dates or uncertainties on the tree) are noted with [RESEARCH NEEDED] tags for verification in archives.
Design: Possibly include a map of 17th-century Plymouth/Middleborough to show settlement locations. A family tree diagram snippet here could zoom in on the first 3–4 generations (Pilgrims down to Jabez Wood Sr.), illustrating the names mentioned. A Historical Context box might cover “The Ship Fortune (1621)” if relevant – since the family tree notes an ancestor arriving on the Fortune, this box can narrate the ship’s significance and hardships (it arrived with new colonists but low supplies). Photo placeholders might include images of Plymouth Plantation recreations or Jenney’s Grist Mill (to represent Abigail Jenney’s family context).
### Part II: Revolutionary and Civil War Era
Focus: Details the family’s experiences through the late 18th and 19th centuries – covering the American Revolution, westward movements, and the Civil War era. This part places the family’s story in the context of a growing and dividing nation. It follows the Wood (and related) ancestors as they move from New England into New York, Vermont, Canada, and eventually the Midwest. The narrative will highlight patriotic service (e.g., a Revolutionary War soldier in the family) and how subsequent generations were positioned during the Civil War period (even if they did not serve directly, their lives were shaped by the era’s expansion and conflict).
Chapter 3 – Patriots and Pioneers: The Wood Family in Revolutionary Times
Content: Centers on the generation living during the American Revolution. Profiles Philip Wood (b. 1756), who is noted as a Revolutionary War soldier (likely a great-great-grandfather in the Wood line). Describes Philip’s service in the war (if known, e.g., militia participation or battles, [RESEARCH NEEDED] to confirm specifics) and the family’s life in the late 1700s. Discusses how the war and independence shaped the family’s opportunities – e.g., post-war migration to new lands. After the Revolution, some Wood family members moved north: for instance, Samuel Wood (b. 1787), Philip’s son, who lived in Vermont and later relocated to Quebec, Canada. Explores possible reasons for this move (seeking land on the frontier, escaping post-war economic upheaval, etc.) and notes the family’s presence on both sides of the new US–Canada border.
The chapter also touches on other branches in this era (the Bentley, Barber, or Church families, as they appear in the tree). For example, it might mention the maternal lines like Abigail Church (Samuel Wood’s wife) and how New England families spread out after the war. A brief mention of any involvement (direct or indirect) the family had in the War of 1812 or early 19th-century pioneer life can be included for continuity. Throughout, the text provides historical context of Revolutionary America—possibly including a sidebar on daily life for New England families during the war, or how veterans like Philip claimed land grants.
Sources & Notes: Derived from the genealogical data that shows birth/death dates around the 1770s–1800s and explicit notes like Philip’s war service. Secondary sources such as state Revolutionary War rosters or pension records might be cited if Philip’s records are located (else flagged in [RESEARCH NEEDED]). The From Mayflower to Midwest document provides continuity of the lineage through this period (mentioning the move to Vermont/Canada). We will corroborate those details with primary documents where possible (e.g., land deeds in Vermont, church records in Quebec). If the scanned family tree lists any patriotic society memberships (e.g., DAR or SAR notes), those will be indicated. Discrepancies in dates or names between the family tree and sources will be noted and resolved in footnotes or the Research Opportunities section.
Design: A timeline infographic for the 18th century could be included, highlighting 1776 and family milestones (births, marriages, migrations). A map of early United States and Canada might show family movement from Massachusetts to Vermont to Quebec. If available, a facsimile of a Revolutionary War muster roll or pension application for Philip Wood can be included as a document reproduction. A Historical Context breakout box could explain “New England Families in the Revolutionary War” (e.g., how common it was for multiple generations to fight, impact on communities).
Chapter 4 – From Independence to Union: Family Life through the Civil War
Content: Follows the family into the 19th century, leading up to and through the American Civil War era. Even if the direct ancestors did not serve as soldiers in the Civil War, this chapter examines where they were and what they experienced in the mid-1800s. By this time, the Wood family line (and connected families like the Bentleys, Wagners, etc.) had moved westward. For example, Franklin Wood (b. 1815) lived in New York, and his son George S. Wood (b. 1858) was born in Chicago. This indicates that by the mid-19th century, part of the family was settling in the Midwest. The chapter describes what it meant for the family to move from the East Coast to the frontier/Midwest during the 1850s–1860s – tying in broader themes like the westward expansion, the rise of Midwestern cities like Chicago, and how the coming of the Civil War affected these regions.
It will also discuss any known family involvement in the Civil War. If military service documentation is found (e.g., perhaps a brother or cousin of an ancestor enlisted), it will be narrated here (with details like regiment and theater of war) or noted as a research opportunity if unknown. The family’s perspective might have been as settlers rather than soldiers: for instance, if the Woods were in Illinois/Wisconsin by the 1860s, they lived in Union states—what was life like there during the war? We can include anecdotes such as how the war’s outcome (Union victory, emancipation) might have reached their community. If the family had members in Canada (Quebec) during this time, contrast their experience with those in the U.S. (the Canadian branch would have been observers to the conflict down south).
The chapter bridges into the post-war period, noting the family’s continued movement and growth. By 1889, we know the stage is set for Czech immigrants to join the family in Wisconsin – so this chapter closes by highlighting how by the late 19th century the Wood/Bentley family is established in the Midwest (Two Rivers, WI and Chicago), setting the scene for Part IV.
Sources & Notes: This section leans on secondary family sources for location and occupation info (census records from 1850–1880 could be referenced if available, showing the Woods in NY/IL). The Wood Reunion Book (2019) likely has narratives or notes on the 19th-century generations, such as George S. Wood marrying Mary Wagner Bentley and moving to Wisconsin. We will use that data, cross-referenced with the original chart. Where the chart or book is vague (e.g., if Civil War service isn’t mentioned but possible), we insert [RESEARCH NEEDED] for checking military archives. We’ll clearly indicate which facts are confirmed (e.g., birth/marriage locations) and which are conjectural or in need of verification (e.g., why the family moved or details of daily life, which might come from local histories).
Design: Maps will be useful – showing migration from New England to the Midwest by tracing routes or marking where each generation lived circa 1800, 1850, 1870 etc. A Civil War era timeline or pictorial spread might show key U.S. events (e.g., 1861–1865 war timeline) alongside family events (e.g., 1863 – X family in Illinois, perhaps a family photo if one exists from the 19th century). A document reproduction idea: include an image of an 1860s land deed or a Civil War draft registration list if an ancestor’s name appears (if none found, perhaps a representative image of a Civil War draft notice for context). Any known photographs of 19th-century ancestors (even late 1800s) could be placed with captions. A Historical Context breakout could be “Life in 19th-Century Midwest” – explaining what Two Rivers or Chicago was like when the family arrived (industry, immigrant communities, etc.), to foreshadow the next part with Czech immigrants.
### Part III: The New England Planters and Quabbin Valley Heritage
Focus: Dives into two unique chapters of the family’s New England heritage that go beyond the main line: (1) the family’s involvement in the New England Planters migration to Nova Scotia (1750s–1760s), and (2) the legacy of the family’s ancestral lands in the Quabbin Valley of Massachusetts. These topics illustrate the family’s broader connections to New England history, even in branches that are collateral to the direct line. This part will feel like a set of deep-dive case studies, enriching the main narrative with museum-like historical explorations.
Chapter 5 – New England Planters: The Freeman and Harlow Migration to Nova Scotia
Content: Tells the story of an extended family branch that participated in the New England Planters movement. Specifically, it follows Patience Wood (b. 1729) – sister of direct ancestor Jabez Wood Jr. – who married Simeon Freeman. In 1761, Patience and Simeon Freeman, with their young children, joined the approximately 8,000 New England Planters who resettled Nova Scotia. The chapter explains the historical backdrop: after the 1755 Acadian expulsion, the colonial government invited English-speaking Protestant families to repopulate vacated lands in Nova Scotia. The Freemans took up this offer, receiving land (the text can detail that they settled in or near Liverpool, Nova Scotia). The narrative follows their life there: building a community among other Planter families, facing the challenges of carving out farms and towns on the new frontier (which, though only a sea away from New England, had its own hardships). It notes that their son Samuel Freeman married Rebecca Harlow, daughter of another Planter family, cementing a little New England transplant community in Nova Scotia.
Although this Freeman-Harlow branch is collateral (not direct ancestors of Christopher Konecny), it’s included to show the richness of the family tapestry and the adventurous spirit present in the extended family. It also demonstrates how the original family tree recorded such branches (the chart likely had a note like “Patience Wood → Nova Scotia Planters”). We use this to emphasize that not all relatives stayed in Massachusetts; some took bold moves that parallel later migrations (and indeed, some of those Nova Scotia Planter descendants may have later lines that returned to the States or spread elsewhere).
Sources & Notes: Uses information from the Mayflower to Midwest research where the Planter story is explicitly described. Additional historical sources (e.g., Nova Scotia archives, Planter registers) are referenced to confirm details of the Freeman family in Liverpool. Since this chapter is more historical context, it may rely less on family oral history and more on regional history (but tied back to known family individuals). We will cite sources like the Nova Scotia historical society or Pier 21 immigration history for context on the Planters. The original family chart’s mention of “went to Nova Scotia” (if present) is corroborated by these references. Any uncertainties (for example, if a date of departure isn’t recorded) will be noted as [RESEARCH NEEDED] for possibly examining colonial correspondence or land grant documents.
Design: Includes a map of the 18th-century Atlantic highlighting the route from New England (Middleborough, MA) to Nova Scotia, and marking the area of Liverpool, NS. A Historical Context breakout box on “New England Planters (1759–1768)” will provide background: who the Planters were, why they went (with maybe a brief note on the expelled Acadians for context). Visuals might include an image of a Nova Scotia land grant document or a photograph of the area where Planters settled (e.g., an old church or cemetery in Liverpool that traces back to Planter times). Possibly a family tree sidebar showing how the Freemans branch off from the main Wood line (to clarify Patience Wood’s place in the family). This chapter could be treated as a “spotlight” with slightly different design – e.g., a different color background – since it’s a side journey from the direct lineage.
Chapter 6 – Quabbin Valley Roots: Settling and Losing the Swift River Towns
Content: Explores the family’s deep roots in the Quabbin Valley of Massachusetts and the later loss of those lands due to the creation of the Quabbin Reservoir. The narrative begins by explaining the note found on the original family tree: that some Wood ancestors were “original proprietors of the Quabbin, Mass. area”. This refers to ancestors like Jabez Wood Jr. (b. 1720) and others of that era who were among the first European settlers of towns in the Swift River Valley (the area that would centuries later be flooded). We identify which ancestor(s) this applies to – likely Jabez Wood Jr. and his wife Joanna Short were in the right generation to be early proprietors in western Massachusetts. The chapter then jumps forward to the 20th century, recounting how Massachusetts, in the 1920s–1930s, undertook a monumental engineering project to create the Quabbin Reservoir to supply Boston with water. It describes how four towns (Dana, Enfield, Greenwich, Prescott) were completely disincorporated and submerged by 1939.
The emotional punch here is that the Wood family’s ancestral lands – the very farms or homesteads their 18th-century forebears settled – were among those lost underwater. We’ll tell the story of the Quabbin evacuation: ~2,500 residents relocated, homes and even cemeteries moved. Perhaps a particular ancestral homestead or a family cemetery was affected (if known, e.g., if an ancestor’s grave had to be moved to Quabbin Park Cemetery, that will be noted). This connects personal family history to a broader historical event in Massachusetts. The chapter might then reflect on how a legacy can be “submerged but not forgotten” – with the family’s presence recorded in deeds and the family tree, even if the physical place is gone.
Sources & Notes: Based on the family tree annotation and the in-depth explanation provided in the research document. We will use Massachusetts historical sources for the Quabbin story (e.g., Mass.gov articles on Quabbin history, historical society publications about the lost towns) to ensure accuracy of that narrative. For genealogical specifics: land grant or proprietors’ lists from the 1730s–1740s (if available) could be cited to show a Wood ancestor’s name. The From Mayflower to Midwest document explicitly ties the family to Quabbin’s story, and we will cite that to show the link. Where the story on the family side is sparse (the chart likely only had a phrase), we transparently indicate that the notion of them being proprietors comes from family lore/chart and is supported by contextual research (but [RESEARCH NEEDED] to find the exact land deeds or town records to fully confirm the claim, if not already confirmed).
Design: Rich visuals here: a map of the Quabbin Valley before and after flooding (perhaps an overlay map or two maps side by side – one showing the old towns, another showing the reservoir covering them). Photographs of the Quabbin Reservoir or remnants of the towns (foundations, the relocated Quabbin Park Cemetery entrance, etc.) can provide a poignant touch. If any old property or county maps listing original landowners exist, include a snippet highlighting the Wood (or related) name. A Document reproduction idea: an image of the Massachusetts General Court act authorizing the reservoir, or a newspaper clipping announcing the towns’ closure, to contextualize the gravity of the event. A Historical Context box might be titled “The Drowning of Four Towns: Creating Quabbin (1927–1939)” to give more background on why and how it happened, complementing the personal angle. This chapter likely will be visually arresting and possibly a bit emotional, bridging the gap between 18th-century family activities and 20th-century consequences.
### Part IV: Czech/Bohemian Immigration (1889–1899)
Focus: Chronicles the arrival of the Konecny family from Bohemia (Czech lands) to the American Midwest in the late 19th century. This part shifts the scene to Central Europe and then Wisconsin, describing why and how the Konecny ancestors emigrated, and what their early immigrant life was like. It provides cultural context about Bohemian immigration to the US and introduces the patriarch and matriarch of the Konecny line in America (Christopher’s great-grandparents). This part is rich in personal struggle and triumph, highlighting the immigrant narrative that later converges with the colonial-descended Wood family.
Chapter 7 – From Bohemia to Wisconsin: The Konecny Immigrant Story
Content: Opens in the late 1800s in Bohemia (Austro-Hungarian Empire), giving a brief picture of the Konecny family’s origins. It explains the surname “Konecny” (originating from “konečný”, meaning “final” or “last” in Czech) and its likely significance – perhaps denoting a family living at the end of a village or a youngest son’s line. We identify the key emigrants: Frank Konecny’s parents (Christopher’s great-grandparents). While their personal names would be given (e.g., if known from the family tree: perhaps Josef Konecny and Anna [Surname]), the narrative describes their decision to emigrate from Bohemia around the 1890s (exact year to be confirmed – [RESEARCH NEEDED: Czech parish records and passenger lists] to pin down details). They likely were part of the wave of Central European immigrants seeking opportunity in the United States around that time.
The chapter follows their journey: possibly departing from a port like Bremen or Hamburg, crossing the Atlantic, and arriving in America (New York or another port) – this is an opportunity for a Document reproduction of a ship manifest if found (for example, listing a Konecny family arriving in 1889–1895). It then shows their settlement in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, specifically the city of Manitowoc or nearby Two Rivers where many Czech immigrants found industrial jobs. The father (Frank’s father) worked as a welder. We delve into the hardships of immigrant life: limited English proficiency for the mother, working-class struggles, and, as the family story notes, tragedy – Frank’s father was killed in a work accident, leaving his wife widowed and young Frank Konecny effectively on his own by age 11. The narrative here is poignant: Frank had to fend for himself as a child in the early 20th century, which speaks to his resilience and character.
Despite these hardships, Frank’s upbringing in Wisconsin is recounted: how he managed to survive and eventually thrive. Perhaps community support or his own resourcefulness saw him through. The chapter likely closes with Frank reaching young adulthood – he would go on to serve in WWII, but that will be detailed later. Here we set the stage: by the turn of the 20th century, the Konecny family had established itself in America, bringing a proud Czech heritage into the family tree.
Sources & Notes: The primary source for this content is family oral history and the From the Mayflower to the Midwest narrative. It provides specific details about Frank’s father’s death and Frank’s early life, which we cite to ensure accuracy. We will attempt to corroborate these with primary records: e.g., check the 1900 or 1910 U.S. Census for Frank’s family (to get parents’ names, immigration year, etc.), and search for Manitowoc newspaper archives about any workplace accident (to confirm the father’s death). These efforts might be ongoing (hence [RESEARCH NEEDED] flags for locating immigration/naturalization papers (1889–1899) and Czech parish birth records for the family). The chapter will clearly state when certain facts are drawn from family memory versus found in documentation. The Wood Reunion Book may mention Frank Konecny’s background briefly when discussing Marjorie’s husband; if so, that will be referenced too.
Design: To immerse readers in the Czech origins, include a map of Europe showing Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), pinpointing the hometown or region from which the Konecny family came (if known, e.g., Prague, or a rural region). Possibly include historical photos of Czech villagers from the 1890s to visualize their pre-immigration life. A timeline could show key dates: emigration year, settlement in Wisconsin year, birth of Frank, etc., alongside world events (e.g., 1880s Czech immigration wave, 1914 WWI begins affecting homeland). Use a Photo placeholder for an image of Manitowoc or Two Rivers circa 1900 – maybe a harbor or factory where Frank’s father might have worked. A Historical Context breakout might be “Bohemian Immigration to America” – explaining why many Czechs left (land shortages, political issues under Austro-Hungarian rule, the lure of American jobs, etc.) and noting the communities they formed in the Midwest. Cultural touches like a picture of a Czech Bible or heirloom (if any survived in the family) or traditional costume could add visual richness. Throughout, the design will use fonts or decorative motifs subtly reflecting Czech folk art (for this chapter’s theme) and possibly color-coding to distinguish the Konecny line.
(Note: A short side section or breakout within this chapter might feature “Life in Bohemia – Traditions and Culture”, providing a snapshot of the heritage the Konecny family brought with them, e.g., language, foods, customs. This can be integrated as a half-page box with illustrations of Czech cultural items. It sets up interest for the later “Family Recipes & Traditions” section where some Czech or Wisconsin Czech recipes might appear.)
### Part V: Union of Colonial and Immigrant Lines (Wood–Konecny Marriage)
Focus: Highlights the pivotal moment where the two major branches of the family tree – one descending from colonial New England and the other from Czech immigrants – unite through marriage. Part V covers mid-20th century events, primarily the courtship and marriage of Marjorie Wood (descendant of the Wood/Howland line) and Frank Konecny (son of the Bohemian immigrants) in 1947. It examines their backgrounds, the significance of their union, and how it symbolizes the blending of two American narratives. This part personalizes the concept of the American “melting pot” by telling the story of one couple.
Chapter 8 – A 1947 Union: Marjorie Wood and Frank Konecny’s Marriage
Content: Sets the scene in post-World War II Wisconsin. Introduces Marjorie Mae Wood and Frank J. Konecny as individuals before marriage. Marjorie (born 1925 in Madison, WI) grew up as the daughter of Colonel Norman B. Wood and Mae Chill, and as such, she carried the legacy of colonial New England families who had come west. She was well-educated (attended University of Wisconsin, journalism major) and worked as a society page editor, even interviewing Charlton Heston after his Oscar win. Frank Konecny, by contrast, was the son of recent immigrants we met in Part IV; he had a rough childhood but became a Navy sailor in WWII (serving in the South Pacific) and afterward a hardworking man in manufacturing. The chapter describes how Frank and Marjorie met (if known, possibly in Two Rivers where Marjorie’s family settled and Frank lived) and their courtship in the mid-1940s.
Their wedding in 1947 is depicted as the literal and symbolic joining of two lineages. We might include anecdotal details: the ceremony, attendees, any special blend of traditions (for example, did they incorporate any Czech customs or New England family traditions at the wedding?). The narrative emphasizes what this marriage represents: “the merging of two quintessential American narratives” – one being the centuries-old Yankee heritage Marjorie embodied, and the other the fresh immigrant striving that Frank’s life exemplified. It notes that after marrying, they made their home in Two Rivers, WI, becoming a central hub for the extended family and embodying the post-war American dream (stable job, community involvement, etc.).
The chapter may also highlight the family trees merging: perhaps showing a simplified pedigree chart of Marjorie’s and Frank’s ancestry side by side up to them, to illustrate how many threads converge in their children. In prose, it can reflect on how unusual or special it is that Marjorie could count Mayflower passengers among her ancestors while Frank was a first-generation American – a span of American history all coming together. Quotes or memories from relatives about Frank and Marjorie’s relationship can add warmth (e.g., describing their personalities, Frank’s Czech accent or humor, Marjorie’s New England-rooted values or perhaps her pride in her heritage).
Sources & Notes: Much of this comes from the Mayflower to Midwest narrative which explicitly covers Frank and Marjorie’s marriage and their biographical details. The Wood Reunion Book (2019) also likely contains a profile of Marjorie (Wood) Konecny, and possibly Frank, providing confirmation of dates and personal anecdotes (“Marjorie passed away in 1993, Frank in 2006” is noted in the narrative). We will use those and cite accordingly. Primary sources might include a copy of their marriage certificate (as a document image if available) and local newspaper clippings (e.g., a marriage announcement in 1947). The chapter notes if any details are uncertain (like exactly how they met – [RESEARCH NEEDED] if family lore is unclear). But generally, this is well-documented in family sources. The significance commentary (melting pot idea) is drawn from the analysis in the research doc.
Design: A highlight of this chapter will be photographs – we anticipate including a [PHOTO PLACEHOLDER] for Frank and Marjorie’s wedding photo (if one exists, e.g., a black-and-white snapshot from 1947). Additional images might include Marjorie in her university or journalism days, Frank in Navy uniform during WWII, and later in life. The layout could feature a split-page design: one side themed for Marjorie’s lineage (maybe a faint Mayflower or colonial motif), the other for Frank’s (Czech motifs or an image of the ship he served on). A small map inset might show Two Rivers, WI, locating it in relation to where each came from (Madison for Marjorie, Manitowoc for Frank). The Historical Context box could be “America in 1947” – describing the optimistic post-war climate that the newlyweds were part of (baby boom beginning, economic growth, etc.), situating their personal milestone in the larger American story. Sidebars might include mini-bios: one for Col. Norman B. Wood (Marjorie’s father) highlighting his military accolades, and one for Frank’s mother (as an immigrant widow who raised Frank) to honor the matriarchal figure on Frank’s side. These sidebars serve as Notable Ancestors profiles that enrich understanding of the couple’s backgrounds.
Chapter 9 – Merging Legacies: Life as a Wood-Konecny Family
Content: Continues from the wedding into the family life of Frank and Marjorie in the 1950s–1960s. Describes how they established their household in Two Rivers and became active community members. Frank had a remarkable career: he started at a tent & awning company and over 50 years rose to general manager, exemplifying dedication and upward mobility. Marjorie balanced professional work and family: raising three children (Peter, Michael, Sandra) and later indulging her love of travel and volunteering. This chapter paints a picture of their family environment – large gatherings, strong ties to relatives, and maintenance of both New England and Czech traditions. For instance, it can mention that Marjorie would have been aware of her Pilgrim ancestry and perhaps participated in heritage societies, while Frank might have kept alive Czech traditions (like food – foreshadowing the “Beer Brats” recipe in a later section).
A key element to include is how their children (the first generation of combined lineage) were raised with an appreciation for both sides. Perhaps they celebrated both typical American holidays and some ethnic customs from Frank’s side. The chapter might incorporate short anecdotes from the Wood Reunion materials: e.g., mention how the Konecny house was known for its hospitality – “family gatherings at the Konecny house where Uncle Frank made the best brats”. This quote (from Virginia Wood Dagel’s memories) shows the warmth of their home and will tie into the Family Traditions section. We’ll describe any notable events in their later life: travels abroad (the narrative notes they visited Czechoslovakia, Europe, Asia, Australia after the kids were grown), and their legacy in the community.
The chapter concludes with their passing (Marjorie in 1993, Frank in 2006) and a reflection on the significance of their union: by the time of Frank’s death, the family lines that once were worlds apart had been fully integrated for two generations. This sets the stage for Part VI, which will talk about those generations (their children and grandchildren).
Sources & Notes: Content here comes from both the narrative doc and reunion book anecdotes. It is richly backed by family recollections: e.g., Marjorie’s interview with Charlton Heston is a family story, Frank’s work history is documented in the narrative, etc. We will cite those details (like Frank’s Navy service and career, Marjorie’s journalism accolades, etc.). The reference to “Uncle Frank’s brats” and reunions directly ties into this narrative and comes from the reunion book. We will ensure that any direct quotes or specific claims are cited (including Marjorie’s education and awards, Frank’s travel, etc.). If available, primary records like Frank’s military discharge or an obituary for Marjorie could be used to verify dates and accomplishments. We’ll also note any places where more information could be added (for example, [RESEARCH NEEDED] if we want to find Marjorie’s journalism pieces or Frank’s detailed military record). However, the family sources are probably sufficient for the scope of this chapter.
Design: This chapter should feel like a family album. Include multiple photos: Frank and Marjorie with their children in the 1950s (if available), snapshots from later in life or travels (the Wood Reunion book had photos of their trips, etc.). We’ll mark [PHOTO PLACEHOLDER] for e.g. “Frank and Marjorie with their three children, circa 1960” or “On vacation in Czechoslovakia, 1970s”. The layout can incorporate scrapbook elements like handwritten captions or a background of a world map highlighting their travels. A Notable Descendant sidebar might highlight one of their children (e.g., Peter Jan Konecny, who will be the subject of Part VI, perhaps noting his career with Miller Brewing leading the family around the country). Alternatively, sidebars could list the combination of cultural traditions they passed down (like a mini timeline: 1947 – started new family; 1960s – family road trips; 1970s – family reunions established, etc.). Since this chapter is the pivot from history to the living memory of current members, it will have a warm, celebratory tone. Possibly include a small family tree diagram showing Frank and Marjorie’s children and grandchildren (briefly, as a preview to the next part).
### Part VI: 20th Century Generations
Focus: Documents the late 20th-century chapters of the family, primarily the children of Frank and Marjorie and their lives. This part covers roughly the 1950s through 1990s, following how the family spread out geographically and experienced modern American life (education, careers, adoption, reunions, etc.). It shows the family adapting to new opportunities and challenges in the latter half of the 20th century, yet staying connected through reunions and shared heritage. Key figures here include Christopher Peter Konecny’s parents and aunts/uncles. The tone is informative with personal touches, reflecting living memory and recent history.
Chapter 10 – Post-war Prosperity: The Konecny-Wood Children and the Mid-20th Century
Content: Focuses on the children of Frank and Marjorie – namely Peter Jan Konecny (b. 1949), Michael Konecny, and Sandra Konecny – as well as their cousins (like the children of Marjorie’s siblings, e.g., the Taylor/Dagel branch). It describes their upbringing in the 1950s–60s during a booming American economy. For instance, Peter (Christopher’s father) attended the University of Wisconsin, married Jody Toepel in 1971, and had a career with Miller Brewing that took the family across several states. We detail that journey: from Two Rivers roots, Peter’s work led them to live in Syracuse, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, and later retirement in Tennessee. Michael and Sandra’s lives (marriages, careers) are also summarized to complete the picture of that generation.
The chapter highlights significant events like the family’s participation in reunions (e.g., the Wood Family Reunions that started perhaps in 1970s or later, culminating in the 1994 and 2019 big reunions mentioned in the Wood Reunion Book). It might share anecdotes of how the family maintained ties – for example, letters, road trips to visit relatives, or gatherings at holidays. A notable story here: Peter and Jody’s first child Kari was placed for adoption in 1970 and then joyfully reunited with the family decades later, in 2017. That human-interest element shows how the family grew and healed over time.
Also included could be the military or public service of this generation: if Michael or others served in Vietnam or if any of Marjorie’s nephews/nieces did, mention that. Also mention the education emphasis – many in this generation went to college (reflecting the GI Bill era benefits and upward mobility). Sandra’s path (if known) can be included, and any interesting careers (e.g., one might have become a teacher, engineer, etc.). This paints a picture of the family fully participating in the American middle-class story of the late 20th century.
Sources & Notes: A lot of this comes from the Wood Family Reunion Book (2019), which provides updated info on Generation 13 and 14 family members (Norman & Mae’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren). For example, details on Peter Konecny’s career and moves, the fact of Kari’s adoption and reunion, etc., can be cited directly from that source. We will cross-reference these with the narrative doc’s “family today” chapter to ensure consistency. Primary sources like wedding announcements or news articles (if any family members made local news) could supplement, but likely the reunion book and personal communications are the main sources. We will mark sensitive or private details (like exact addresses, or the adoption’s personal particulars) as [PRIVACY] in a public-facing version, but acknowledge them in the family version. Any incomplete information will be flagged – e.g., [RESEARCH NEEDED] if, say, more detail on Michael’s family is desired but not in current sources.
Design: This chapter might be broken into subsections by family unit (one for each of Frank and Marjorie’s children and their spouse/kids). Each subsection could have a family portrait photo (e.g., Peter and Jody with their children in the 1980s, Michael’s family, etc.). We will use captions to identify everyone in photos. A neat design idea: a “family tree branch” graphic for each sibling, showing their descendants (Christopher and siblings under Peter, etc.). Color-code or icon-mark the branches to keep them visually distinct. Sidebars might include Notable Descendants such as highlighting careers: e.g., “Peter Konecny – Corporate Executive and Brewmaster: 30-year career with Miller Brewing” (if appropriate) or “Sandra Konecny – [her profession/achievements]”. Also, include a Historical Context breakout if needed, like “The 1960s–1980s: An Era of Change”, to contextualize what global events (Cold War, tech revolution, etc.) were happening as this generation came of age. But since this is recent, context may be woven into the narrative instead of a formal box. Overall, the design should use more contemporary styling (1950s retro motifs transitioning to modern sleek look by the 1980s content), showing the passage of time visually.
Chapter 11 – Modern Era Milestones: Late-20th Century into the 2000s
Content: Brings the family story up to the brink of the present. This chapter likely covers from the 1980s through 2000s, including events like marriages of the 14th generation (Christopher and his siblings, and their cousins) and significant family gatherings or achievements in that period. For example, Christopher’s sister Lisa’s marriage in 2004 and the family expansion in the 2000s (grandchildren being born). It can also highlight how the family maintained ties despite geographical dispersion – by now, family members are spread coast-to-coast (we have branches in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Florida, etc., per the reunion book’s profiles). The chapter could mention the advent of technology making it easier to stay in touch (emails, social media, etc.) and the continuation of reunions.
A big milestone to include is the 2019 Wood Family Reunion in Two Rivers – since we have a whole book from that event, it’s clearly significant. We can describe the reunion: dozens of relatives from around the country converging at Neshotah Beach, WI, sharing stories and updates, and celebrating their common heritage. Mention that the reunion included sharing this very genealogy work (the 2019 book updated the 1994 genealogy). Perhaps include a snippet about the reunion traditions like “Brats & Beers” – the family cookout tradition with Uncle Frank’s beer-cooked bratwursts.
Additionally, this chapter can note any family losses and honors in the late 20th century: e.g., the passing of older generation members (Frank in 2006 is already noted; Norman Jr. or Katherine Wood in their times, etc.), and maybe honors like someone running a marathon, serving in Iraq/Afghanistan wars (if applicable), etc. It sets the stage for the final part by ensuring all branches of the family are caught up to the present. Essentially, by the end of Chapter 11, the reader knows the broad strokes of every major branch down to those who are alive today.
Sources & Notes: We rely heavily on the Wood Reunion Book (2019) for this chapter, as it contains many profiles of the Generation 14 and 15 individuals (like Christopher’s generation and their kids) – for instance, Christopher’s biography and his siblings’ bios, as well as cousins like Virginia’s family with the Dagels (which included the note about Uncle Frank’s brats and bringing coolers of brats to St. Paul). We will cite those to add color (names, birth years, careers). We’ll ensure sensitive info (like exact birthdates of living people) is either omitted or generalized to protect privacy, as the reunion book itself cautions. The narrative from the initial research doc’s concluding chapters can help summarize where everyone is by the 2000s. Any discrepancies between the 2019 book and the earlier research doc (for example, if someone’s career changed after the doc was written) will be reconciled in favor of the latest info, or noted.
Design: This chapter will likely include collage pages of recent photos – e.g., photos from the 2019 reunion group picture, snapshots of families in the 2000s, etc. These can be arranged yearbook-style with captions naming individuals (where permission is given). A map of the United States with pins showing where various family members live as of 2020s might be a nice visual, emphasizing how far the family has spread from the Mayflower landing point (there’s an appealing full-circle imagery: from Plymouth out to the Midwest and beyond). The Family Reunion might get a dedicated sidebar or even a full-page feature with images of past reunions (with a caption like “Four generations of Woods and Konecnys at the 2019 reunion”). A call-out quote from a reunion speech (if any) or a family elder’s reflection could personalize it. Also consider a timeline of technological change (e.g., listing how communication in the family went from handwritten letters to long-distance phone calls to Facebook groups) to subtly illustrate the changing context of maintaining family bonds. The style here should be modern – likely full-color, clean design, maybe using the family’s preferred colors or a motif from the reunion materials (the reunion book had a designer, Beth Moorcones, maybe use some of that aesthetic for consistency).
### Part VII: Present-Day Legacy and Descendants
Focus: Brings the story into the 21st century and reflects on the family’s legacy. It profiles the current generation (Christopher Peter Konecny and his peers/cousins) and their children, documenting the family as it is today. It also steps back to assess what the family’s journey means: how the sacrifices and adventures of past generations manifest in the lives of current descendants, and how the family history is being preserved and continued. This part is forward-looking too, discussing plans for continued research, the importance of passing down traditions, and the family’s place in the ongoing American story.
Chapter 12 – Entering the 21st Century: The Family Today
Content: Focuses on Christopher Peter Konecny and his immediate family, as a representative of the current generation (Generation 15 in the Wood genealogy count). Christopher’s story is outlined: born in 1979 in Syracuse, NY, moved in childhood to California and Georgia, attained higher education (Bachelor’s and Master’s from University of Georgia), and established a successful career in IT consulting, now a Managing Director at KPMG in Charlotte, NC. His marriage in 2005 to Jessica (JC) Morris is noted, and the birth of their two daughters, Greta (b. 2008) and Sofia (b. 2010). This personal profile exemplifies the opportunities made possible by the family’s long journey – from the Mayflower to a modern thriving life. Similar short profiles are given for his sisters Lisa Konecny Youmans (with her spouse and children, if any) and Kathryn Konecny Chavez (with her spouse Kristopher and children, who were born 2014 and 2018). Also, Kari (Baumann) Haege – their adopted eldest sibling – is highlighted, since her reunion with the family is a powerful modern chapter: after being apart for decades, rejoining the family and now active in it (with her five biological and three adopted children). Each of these profiles shows the family’s diversity and continuity: different careers (engineering, nursing, etc.), different parts of the country, even international elements (e.g., adoption from Africa in Kari’s case), yet all connected by the shared heritage.
The chapter also references how the family honors its past today: for example, family members maintaining genealogy records, joining lineage societies (like the Mayflower Society – noting any current members or pending applications, which the reunion book encourages with proper documentation), and visiting ancestral sites. Perhaps mention if anyone visited Plymouth for the 400th anniversary in 2020, or if they maintain contact with relatives in the Czech Republic. It underscores that the legacy is living: traditions like Uncle Frank’s beer brats are still enjoyed at gatherings, and new traditions are being made. Additionally, it might mention how the family weathered recent historical moments (e.g., if any family members served in the military in the 2000s, or how they coped with events like the 2020 pandemic – though that might be beyond scope, it’s a thought for truly current context).
Sources & Notes: Information here is drawn from the latest available family sources – primarily the 2019 reunion book profiles of Christopher, Lisa, Kathryn, and Kari. We will double-check any changes since 2019 (e.g., additional children, career moves up to 2025) via family input if possible, marking any updates. The narrative doc provides an overview for Peter’s children including Chris, Lisa, Kathryn (confirming their birth years and marriages up to early 2000s). We’ll carefully cite those details to maintain accuracy. Privacy considerations are crucial here: we will avoid sensitive personal data (exact birthdates, addresses) and focus on general life story and accomplishments. Where the reunion book had personal info, we present it in a celebratory but discreet manner.
Design: This final narrative chapter will be accompanied by recent photographs: e.g., Christopher and his family’s portrait, Kari’s big family, Lisa and Kathryn’s families, etc. If possible, a generational photo (like the oldest and youngest present family members together) could make a meaningful image. The design might incorporate an infographic family tree of the whole lineage on one page – perhaps a stylized tree showing John Howland & Elizabeth Tilley at the roots and blooming to the present generation at the branches, with tiny portraits or just names to mark the generations (this could actually serve as a visual summary of the entire book). Another idea is a world map highlighting travels and migrations over the generations, connecting dots from Europe (England, Netherlands for Pilgrims, Czech Republic for Konecnys) to North America (Massachusetts, Nova Scotia, Wisconsin) to where family members live now globally. The tone is forward-looking and celebratory, so the design can use bright colors and optimistic imagery (sunrise, family hands, etc.). Possibly include a quote from a family member about what knowing their family history means to them, to personalize the legacy theme.
Chapter 13 – Reflections and Future Legacy: Keeping the History Alive
Content: This concluding chapter steps back and reflects on the significance of the Konecny family history and how it will be carried forward. It synthesizes the themes: the courage of the Mayflower Pilgrims, the determination of frontier settlers, the resilience of immigrant newcomers, and the unity of diverse backgrounds into one family. It likely reiterates how the family’s story mirrors the American experience of faith, perseverance, migration, and reinvention. Personal reflections could be included – for example, Christopher or another family representative expressing how learning this history has impacted them or why it’s important for the next generation (perhaps in a first-person anecdote or a letter-style sidebar).
This chapter also outlines how the family plans to preserve and build on this legacy. It might mention ongoing genealogical efforts – such as plans to digitize all family records, maintain an online family tree or Facebook group, and coordinate regular reunions or heritage trips (e.g., maybe someone is planning a trip to the Czech Republic to see ancestral villages, or to Plymouth for a anniversary). The role of DNA testing could be touched on: for instance, encouraging more members to do DNA kits to confirm distant cousins or discover new relatives (linking to the DNA section placeholder). It could also identify the next custodians of family lore – e.g., “passing the torch” of the family historian role to someone from the younger generation.
Finally, the chapter expresses gratitude to past generations (maybe even a call-out list of names of key ancestors as a “roll of honor”) and encourages the living family to keep sharing stories and traditions (like those recipes, reunions, etc.). It’s an uplifting finish that closes the narrative with hope that the Konecny family story will continue to evolve and be told for generations to come.
Sources & Notes: This section is more essay-like and forward-looking, so it doesn’t rely on historical sources for facts as much as the earlier chapters. However, it will echo sentiments from the conclusion of the research doc (which eloquently summarized the family’s journey) – we will paraphrase or quote those as a fitting wrap-up to show continuity from research to book. If any family members have written a dedication or preface in the sources, we might include a snippet. No new citations are likely needed except those tying back to earlier parts for thematic emphasis.
Design: This last chapter might be shorter, perhaps 2-3 pages, and can feature a collage of family photos through the ages faded in the background (Pilgrim-era illustration, an old 19th-century photo, early 20th-century, mid 20th, and a current photo – illustrating the sweep of time visually). A stylized family tree illustration (as mentioned) could either go here or in the previous chapter. We may also include a quote or poem about family, heritage, or time (some families choose a motto or scripture – if the Konecnys have one, it can be placed here). If print format allows, we might even list all family members’ names alive at the time of publication as a tribute (subject to privacy considerations, possibly more appropriate for the private family edition). The final page could be a single photo of the extended family or something symbolic like an image of an oak tree (symbolizing strength and roots) with a caption about the family’s roots and branches. The design aim is to leave the reader with a sense of closure, pride, and continuity.
## 4. Key Special Sections
(These sections are special features that appear throughout the book, set off from the main narrative. They enrich the book with extra information and anecdotes. Below is an outline of each type, with examples of content and where they might appear.)
“Notable Descendants” Sidebars: These are highlight boxes focusing on particularly noteworthy individuals in or related to the family, appearing in relevant chapters. Each sidebar is a short bio or story that adds depth without interrupting the main narrative flow.
Examples:
Colonel Norman Bentley Wood (1889–1950): Placed in Part VI or alongside Chapter 8, detailing Norman’s distinguished military career (Mexican Border Campaign, WWI & WWII service with Silver Star, etc.) and his role as a community leader in Two Rivers. This sidebar would include a photo of Norman in uniform and bullet points of his achievements, giving context to Marjorie’s upbringing.
Presidential Connections: In Part I, a sidebar listing famous Americans descended from John Howland & Elizabeth Tilley (e.g., FDR and the Bush presidents). This emphasizes the wide impact of the Pilgrim lineage and subtly elevates the cachet of the family’s heritage.
Kari Baumann Haege: In Part VII, a sidebar on Kari’s unique story of adoption and reunion with her birth family. It would highlight her life journey and how it enriches the family’s modern story (e.g., her adopting children from Africa, symbolizing the family’s openness and love extending globally).
Other possibilities: A short feature on Henry Wood as an early settler (his significance in Middleborough’s founding), or on Uncle Frank Konecny himself – maybe an anecdote about how after serving in the Navy, he became the beloved “grillmaster” uncle known for beer brats and community spirit. Also, if any family member has an interesting claim to fame (like someone worked on a notable project, or an artistic achievement), they could get a sidebar.
Design: These sidebars will be formatted distinctively (perhaps shaded background or insets) with a title like “Notable Descendant: [Name]” and a brief text. They may include a small portrait or relevant icon. They serve as quick reading pieces to inspire pride and interest. Importantly, they will always appear near the chapter where that person is first prominent. Citations to sources (e.g., Norman’s sidebar would cite the research doc for his military honors) are included as needed.
“Historical Context” Breakout Boxes: These sections provide readers with background on historical events, places, or cultural aspects that intersect with the family’s story. Written in an accessible, encyclopedia-like style, they appear at logical points to explain terms or contexts that the main narrative touches on, giving a museum-exhibit feel.
Examples:
The Mayflower and Plymouth Colony: A box in Part I explaining what the Mayflower voyage entailed, the significance of the Mayflower Compact, and life in Plymouth Colony circa 1620–1630. It complements Chapter 1 by giving more detail on Pilgrim society (useful for readers less familiar with this history).
The Ship “Fortune” (1621): In Part IV or near early chapters, a note on the Fortune’s arrival and its impact on Plymouth. This is triggered by the family tree note about an ancestor arriving on the Fortune, thus educating readers on that often-overlooked second ship and the tough winter that followed.
New England Planters: In Part III, a context box elaborating on who the New England Planters were, why they went to Nova Scotia, and how that migration worked. It might include a small map of Annapolis Valley or stats (e.g., “8000 Yankees to Nova Scotia, 1759–1768”).
Quabbin Reservoir Creation: A box in Part III describing the legislation and process of creating Quabbin (how Boston’s water needs grew, the engineering of the reservoir, the human impact). This backs up Chapter 6’s story with factual detail and perhaps a photograph of the reservoir under construction.
Bohemian Immigration Wave: In Part IV, a cultural context box about Czech immigration to America (e.g., numbers of Czech immigrants 1850–1900, where they settled, what jobs they took, and how they kept culture alive). Could mention things like the prevalence of brewing and bakeries among Czechs (tying into Wisconsin’s beer and sausage tradition, which Frank embraced).
World War II – Pacific Theater: Since Frank and Norman served in WWII, a box might outline the broader scope of WWII service. For Frank, maybe a focus on the US Navy in the South Pacific (to contextualize his service), and for Norman, perhaps the overall US Army campaigns in the Pacific where he earned his honors.
Quabbin Valley Ecosystem: Possibly a small nature/history box describing what the Swift River Valley was like (the villages, the environment) before it was flooded, to enrich that story.
Design: These context boxes will likely span a column or half-page, with a different font or color scheme, possibly with archival images (like a painting of Plymouth, a map, or an old document snippet) to draw the eye. They will be captioned clearly, e.g., “Historical Context: The New England Planters” or simply a bold lead-in line. They won’t interrupt sentences – rather, placed at the top or bottom of a page or between chapters. We ensure the content is concise (a few paragraphs or bullet points) and directly relevant. Sources will be cited for factual accuracy (e.g., if we mention a number of Planters or a date, we’ll footnote the historical source). These boxes add educational value and depth, aligning with the museum-quality goal of the book.
“DNA & Genetic Heritage” Section (Placeholder): A dedicated section (likely near the end, or as an appendix) reserved for discussing the family’s genetic ancestry insights. Currently, it’s a placeholder, meaning we acknowledge its importance but details may be pending further research/testing.
Content Plan: This section will explain how modern DNA testing can complement genealogical research. It would discuss any DNA tests taken by family members (e.g., 23andMe, AncestryDNA, etc.) and summarize the findings: ethnic percentages (confirming the English and Bohemian roots, and possibly uncovering any surprises), haplogroups (maternal/paternal lines), and matching cousins that corroborate the paper trail. If, for example, a test showed ~50% Bohemian, ~40% British, ~10% other European, we’d present that in a chart or diagram. We would also mention if DNA has helped solve or could solve certain mysteries (like confirming a suspected distant cousin in Nova Scotia or finding what region of Bohemia the family came from).
We’ll note any future plans for DNA analysis (hence placeholder): e.g., encouraging more relatives to test, or using advanced techniques like Y-DNA or mtDNA tests to track the paternal Konecny line in Europe or the maternal Mayflower line. We could also mention if the family has considered uploading DNA data to genealogy databases to find previously unknown relatives (there might be descendants of siblings of ancestors who went elsewhere).
Design: The DNA section could include a colorful pie chart or ethnicity map illustrating the genetic makeup of Christopher or an average across several family members. A map could have shaded areas over Bohemia, England, etc., corresponding to genetic ancestry percentages. There may also be a diagram of the Y-chromosome line (if traced, e.g., showing male-line from a Konecny ancestor in Bohemia down to present) or mtDNA line from an early maternal ancestor. Since this is a placeholder, the design might literally have a note “Awaiting DNA results – to be updated in future edition” if tests haven’t been done yet. But even as a placeholder, it sets an expectation and plan for including cutting-edge genealogical methods. It ensures the book remains forward-compatible with new info.
“Mysteries & Research Opportunities” Section: A special section (perhaps at the end of each relevant chapter or collected near the end) that identifies unresolved questions in the family history and provides concrete next steps to investigate them. This is a proactive feature turning the book into a living document that can guide future researchers (like younger family members) on where to look next.
Content: We will list specific family history mysteries that remain unsolved, each with a short description and suggested research actions. For instance:
Czech Parish Records for the Konecny family [RESEARCH NEEDED]: Noting that while we know the Konecny ancestors came from Bohemia, we need to pinpoint their exact hometown and obtain birth/baptism records from Czech archives. Next steps: “Locate the Konecny surname in Czech parish registries around 1860–1890, possibly in Southern Bohemia; consult the Czech National Archives or church record databases; hire a local genealogist in Czech Republic if necessary.” This would help confirm earlier generations and maybe connect with any distant relatives in Europe.
Immigration & Naturalization Documents (1889–1899) [RESEARCH NEEDED]: Explaining that we seek the passenger list and naturalization papers for Frank’s parents. Next steps: “Search Ellis Island and Castle Garden databases for Konecny arrivals in the late 1880s; check Milwaukee/Chicago court naturalization records around 1890s; examine census 1900, 1910 entries for immigration year clues.” This will solidify the immigration narrative with primary evidence.
Military Service Documentation [RESEARCH NEEDED]: While we have anecdotal info on ancestors’ service (Revolutionary War, Civil War, WWI, WWII), we might lack official records. Next steps: “Request Revolutionary War pension files for Philip Wood; lookup Civil War draft registrations for any Wood/Bentley men of age; obtain WWII service records for Frank Konecny and Norman B. Wood (through the National Archives); gather any letters or medals in family possession to document their service.” This ensures their sacrifices are formally recorded in the family archive.
Quabbin Property Deeds [RESEARCH NEEDED]: To substantiate the family lore about Quabbin proprietors, we should find the actual deeds or town records. Next steps: “Examine Hampshire County land records for 1730s–1740s for Wood (or related surnames) land grants; review published lists of landowners in the four towns before flooding; contact the Quabbin Reservoir History office for any compilations of original families.” This could verify the claim in black and white.
DNA Interpretation [RESEARCH NEEDED]: While the DNA section outlines current understanding, deeper analysis could unlock more. Next steps: “Perform Y-DNA test on a male Konecny relative to trace paternal line to specific villages; use GEDmatch or other tools to identify how the family connects to other Howland/Tilley descendants; consult a genetic genealogist to interpret any enigmatic segments (e.g., small percentages that might hint at an unknown ancestor).” Essentially, leverage genetic data to either confirm the paper trail or reveal new avenues.
Cemetery and Burial Records [RESEARCH NEEDED]: Many ancestors’ final resting places are known (e.g., Frank and Marjorie likely in Two Rivers), but some earlier ones might not be documented. Next steps: “Survey family cemeteries in Wisconsin for all Konecny/Wood graves; find burial records for the Wood ancestors in Middleborough and Quabbin towns (possibly moved to Quabbin Park Cemetery); create a FindAGrave or BillionGraves index for the family. This can often yield birth/death dates and even connect with distant cousins who visit those sites.”
(Additional if applicable: Mayflower Line Verification [RESEARCH NEEDED]: Although we have the lineage, original vital records for a couple of connections (like Philip Wood or Samuel Wood’s birth/marriage) are needed to formally join the General Society of Mayflower Descendants. Next steps: “Obtain baptismal records from Vermont or Massachusetts archives for those generations; use GSMD’s resources to confirm each parent-child link.”)*
Each item above will be formatted with a clear header and a bullet or numbered list of steps, making it actionable. We may include checkboxes or blank lines as if encouraging the next researcher to tick off accomplishments – enhancing the interactive, research handbook aspect of the book.
Design: This section could appear as a chapter-end summary or a consolidated list in an appendix. It might use an icon (like a magnifying glass or question mark) to signal a research query. The layout might have the unresolved question in italics or bold, followed by the next steps in smaller text. For print, we could even leave a bit of whitespace for notes (so family members can jot down findings as they pursue these tasks). It’s essentially a bridge between the static book and the ongoing family history project.
Sources: While this section is forward-looking, we’ll reference why these items are on the list. For example, we cite that the Wood Reunion book specifically asks for original records for Philip or Samuel Wood, showing it’s a known gap to fill. We also cite where in the narrative or chart the gap is evident (e.g., “family tree shows arrival year as ~1890, but no ship manifest located yet”). This anchors the to-do list in the context given by the book’s content.
“Family Recipes & Traditions” Section: A special treat in the book highlighting beloved family recipes, customs, and cultural traditions passed down through generations. This section adds a personal, intimate flavor to the history, moving beyond dates and places to the sensory experiences of family heritage.
Content: We feature a handful of recipes and traditions, each with a bit of commentary or story. The star of the section will be Uncle Frank’s Beer Brats recipe, as requested. We’ll present it in a recipe format with ingredients and steps, prefaced by a note about how Frank Konecny (affectionately known as “Uncle Frank” to many in the extended family) would man the grill at family gatherings, grilling bratwurst simmered in beer and onions. We will quote the humorous line from the reunion book: “A Wood reunion would not be complete without copious amounts of beer and...brats! That’s Uncle Frank manning the grill... This recipe is Uncle Frank’s original...”, demonstrating the provenance of the recipe. Credit will be given to Virginia (Wood) Dagel for preserving it, as mentioned.
Other possible inclusions: Grandma Mae’s Kolaches (if the Czech side had a traditional pastry – speculative unless we have a source; if not, we might include a Czech Christmas cookie recipe to represent that culture), New England Clam Chowder or Johnnycakes (to represent the Pilgrim heritage in cuisine), Aunt [Name]’s Apple Pie if famous in family, etc. Also, non-food traditions: for example, “Every Christmas, the family sings Silent Night in Czech” or “At reunions, the family plays a baseball game” – these can be described. If the Wood family had any notable tradition (like making maple syrup in Vermont or an annual Memorial Day gathering), those are good to mention.
Each recipe/tradition will have a short narrative: why it’s meaningful, who introduced it, and any historical tie-in. For instance, beer brats are a very Wisconsin tradition, fitting for a family that settled there (we might note how German and Czech immigrants popularized beer brats in Wisconsin, giving a tiny historical aside within the recipe). Or if we include Kolache (a Czech pastry), mention that it’s a classic Czech immigrant treat that perhaps Frank’s mother made.
We will ensure Uncle Frank’s Beer Brats is clearly highlighted – possibly even using a larger font or decorative border – since it’s specifically requested.
Design: This section can be visually rich: think recipe cards or a scrapbook feel. Use perhaps a faux-handwritten font for recipe titles to mimic a family recipe card. Include photos of the food if available or stock images (e.g., a tempting shot of bratwursts on a grill and a cold beer mug next to it – to make readers practically smell the onions and hops). For digital versions, perhaps even embed a short video QR code of a family member demonstrating the recipe (if that exists or could be created). The layout might be two-column: one for the narrative/story, one for the recipe instructions. Or it could be a full-page per recipe with a photo background. We’ll ensure the recipe is easy to follow if someone wants to cook it.
Possibly include a Traditions collage – pictures of, say, the family around a Christmas tree, or wearing matching reunion T-shirts, or doing a unique family ritual (like an annual toast). Captions will explain those traditions.
Sources: The main source for the Beer Brats is the Wood Reunion book blurb; we’ll cite it to affirm authenticity. Other recipes or traditions may come from interviews or known family lore (we might not have citations for those if they weren’t in provided sources, but we could note e.g., “(Source: Wood family oral history, 2019 reunion)”). This section is slightly less formal academically, but it still contributes to the family’s ethnography, so we treat it seriously in terms of documentation.
## 5. Visual Assets Plan
To create a true coffee-table book experience, a robust visual plan is essential. The following outlines the visual elements and design considerations for both print and digital formats:
Family Tree Diagrams: We will include family tree graphics for each major branch and an overall combined tree. These diagrams translate the complex genealogical information into an easy-to-follow visual.
Major Branch Trees: For example, a Wood Family Tree diagram starting from Henry Wood (Generation 1 in New World) down to Marjorie Wood’s generation, and a Konecny Family Tree from the known ancestors in Bohemia down to Frank Konecny. These can be placed at the start of Part I and Part IV respectively, or in the appendix. They will use connecting lines, generational labels, and possibly small portraits if available (for more recent generations). We’ll highlight direct ancestors in a different color or with a box around them.
Combined Lineage Tree: An “Ancestral Map” that shows the direct line from the Mayflower generation to the present (Christopher). The research doc even provided a tabular outline of this which can be adapted into a chart or tree form. This could appear in the introduction or appendix. It succinctly shows the chain of descent (John Howland → … → Marjorie → Christopher) with key dates and notes. We will design it as a vertical pedigree or timeline with generational levels.
Design: Family trees will be in high resolution for clarity, possibly spanning fold-out pages or spreads so that fine details (names, dates) are readable. We’ll use consistent symbols (perhaps males squares, females circles, or just names with birth/death years). We might use color coding to denote branches (e.g., blue for paternal line, red for maternal in the merged tree). In digital format, these diagrams can be interactive: clicking a name could show a popup with that person’s bio or photo. We ensure to cite sources for each connection (likely via an endnote or caption referencing where the relationship is documented – e.g., the Mayflower Society lineage book or the family chart). For print, we may add reference numbers by names that tie to the source list in the appendix.
Maps of European Origins and American Migrations: Maps provide geographic context to the family’s movement. We plan to have several maps:
A Europe map highlighting Bohemia (Czech Republic) and any specific town of origin, as well as England/Leiden (for the Pilgrims’ origin). This could be used in Part I to show Pilgrim origins (England to Holland to Plymouth route) and Part IV for the Konecny origins (Bohemia to Bremen/Hamburg to New York). Possibly one combined map with insets: one inset of Europe, one of North America, and lines or arrows indicating migration paths.
Colonial America maps: One showing Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts in the 1600s (for early chapters), including places like Plymouth, Duxbury, Middleborough. Another for Nova Scotia showing Liverpool and other Planter settlements (for Chapter 5).
Quabbin area map: As mentioned, a before-and-after map of Quabbin. Perhaps a historical map of the Swift River Valley towns with an overlay of the reservoir outline. This will be used in Chapter 6.
United States maps: One for 19th-century migrations, highlighting Vermont, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin – tracing how the Wood family moved west. Another could mark key family locations in the 20th century (Wisconsin, Minnesota, Georgia, California, etc.), even up to current (where everyone lives now).
Design: We will use an old-style map aesthetic for historical maps (to match the time period – e.g., sepia tones, hand-drawn style for the 1700s maps), and a cleaner modern style for present-day maps. Map legends or captions will clearly indicate what is being shown (e.g., “Map 1: Pilgrim Migrations 1608–1620” or “Map 5: Wood & Konecny Family Moves in the USA, 1900s”). If possible, add small icons or numbers on the map corresponding to key events (like a ship icon for where/when someone sailed, a house icon for settlement locations). Interactive digital version: maps could be clickable to zoom in or to reveal photos of locations (for example, clicking Two Rivers on the map could pop up a vintage postcard of Two Rivers). All maps will have attributions if based on existing maps (e.g., base map credits, or “drawn by [Designer] based on data from X”).
Quabbin Valley Map (Before Flooding): Called out specifically, this visual is critical to Chapter 6. We plan a detailed map of the Swift River Valley circa early 20th century, labeling the four towns (Dana, Enfield, Greenwich, Prescott) and perhaps marking any locations related to the family if known (like “Wood homestead” if we have that info). Next to it, or overlayed transparently, we show the shape of Quabbin Reservoir that covers them now.
Design: Possibly use a semi-transparent overlay technique: an old map of the towns, with a blue overlay representing the reservoir’s extent. This can be done in print by printing the reservoir shape in a translucent ink color over the map. In digital, could be a slider comparison (before/after). This visual drives home the loss of those towns. A small timeline or arrow might note “1939: Reservoir filled; towns submerged.” We will also include a caption referencing the source of town location data (maybe an old Gazetteer or Mass. archives, and the historical note from Mass.gov about Quabbin).
Timeline Infographics per Century: To help readers keep track of the chronological flow, we’ll include timeline graphics at the start or end of each Part, summarizing key family events in that century alongside major historical events for context.
17th century (1600s): Timeline might show 1620 – Mayflower landing; 1644 – Henry Wood marries Abigail Jenney; 1680s – generation transitions (maybe the Fortune arrival 1621, King Philip’s War 1675 for context).
18th century (1700s): 1756 – Philip Wood born (Rev War soldier); 1761 – Freemans to Nova Scotia; 1775–1783 Revolutionary War timeline bar; 1790s – Samuel Wood to Vermont/Quebec.
19th century (1800s): 1858 – George S. Wood born Chicago; 1861–65 Civil War bar; 1889 – Norman B. Wood born (and also around when Konecny’s immigrate); 1890s – Konecny immigration; 1898 – Spanish-American War (if any family context?).
20th century (might be split into two timelines given how eventful): Early 1900s – Frank Konecny born, Norman B. Wood WWI service; 1920s – Marjorie Wood born; 1941–45 WWII (Frank and Norman’s service); 1947 – Frank & Marjorie marry; 1960s – Peter Konecny marries Jody 1971; 1969 – Moon landing (just context), etc.; 1980s – grandchildren born; 1993 – Marjorie dies, etc.
21st century: 2005 – Christopher marries; 2020 – family survives COVID-19 (maybe? or skip if too narrow); 2025 – present book compiled.
Design: Each timeline will be stylized appropriate to era (e.g., parchment look for 17th–18th c., industrial look for 19th, modern infographic for 20th). Use icons and short text for events. They serve as visual summaries at part openers or footers. In a digital version, timelines could be interactive (hover to see more detail). All information in them is drawn from the narrative (we’ll cite any specific data points that are not obvious; e.g., if we list “1756: Philip Wood born – later Rev War soldier,” we’d source that).
Photographs (Photo Placement Suggestions): Throughout the outline and eventual book, we plan numerous photos, marked in text as [PHOTO PLACEHOLDER] where appropriate. These include:
Historical Photos/Illustrations: Since photography didn’t exist for the early periods, we might use relevant illustrations: e.g., a painting of Mayflower in Plymouth harbor for Chapter 1, or an 19th-century engraving of a New England farm for Chapter 2. For the Planter story, perhaps an old sketch of early Nova Scotia settlers. For Civil War era, maybe a public domain photo of Union soldiers or pioneer wagons to evoke the era (if no direct family photos exist).
Family Photographs: Actual photos likely start from late 19th or early 20th century. We should have: a portrait of Colonel Norman B. Wood in uniform (from WWI or WWII era), wedding photo of Frank and Marjorie (1947), candid family shots from 1950s (Frank and Marjorie with kids), possibly a photo of the Konecny grandparents (Frank’s parents, though given timeline, that might be late 1800s – maybe none, but maybe a picture of Frank as a child or young man). Definitely many from late 20th: the Konecny siblings in youth, reunion group photos, etc. The reunion book PDF likely contains many such images (as indicated by the layout text). We will identify key ones: e.g., Christopher’s family photo at Christmas 2018, or Kari’s family Easter 2003. These can be placed in the relevant narrative (Christopher’s profile, Kari’s story).
Document Reproductions: We plan to include images of important documents as photos as well – e.g., the Mayflower Compact (handwritten page), a copy of an ancestor’s will, the actual handwritten family tree (since it’s scanned, perhaps include it or portions of it as an image to show the beautiful calligraphy or how info was passed down). Other possibilities: a 1790 census entry showing an ancestor’s name, a marriage certificate of Frank and Marjorie, the passenger list with the Konecny name circled, naturalization certificate, etc. These bring authenticity and also serve as evidence in a visually engaging way.
Placement: We will ensure at least one image per chapter, ideally more for later chapters where photography is available. Each Part opener might have a full-page photo relevant to that era (Part I could show Plymouth Rock or Mayflower replica; Part IV might show a turn-of-century photo of Czech immigrants or a Wisconsin scene; Part V perhaps Frank & Marjorie’s wedding portrait as a full page). We have marked [PHOTO PLACEHOLDER] in the outline where specific images would greatly enhance the text (such as the wedding photo in Chapter 8, or Manitowoc harbor in Chapter 7). The final selection will depend on image availability and quality.
Captions & Credits: Every photo will have a caption explaining who/what is shown and the year. Example: “Photo: Frank Konecny and Marjorie Wood on their wedding day, June 1947, Two Rivers, WI. (Family collection)” or “Document: Excerpt of the 1620 Mayflower Compact.” In the case of images from external sources (like historical society or public domain), we’ll credit accordingly in a small font or in the bibliography. For family-sourced photos, we might say “Courtesy of [Name]” if needed. The UI will automatically show the source of the image if we embed from one, so we might not mention the source explicitly in text as per guidelines.
Digital considerations: On a web or e-book version, photos can have higher resolution pop-up or zoom features, and possibly slideshows. We might include short audio clips (like a recorded story by a family elder) or video (like a clip from a reunion) if it were a web version—though that’s beyond a book outline’s scope, it’s worth noting as a design idea.
Document Reproductions (Ship Manifests, Census, Certificates): As part of the visuals (some overlap with photos above), we specifically plan these archival documents images to emphasize primary sources behind the history.
Examples to include:
The ship manifest for the Konecny immigration (if found). It would list Frank’s parents arriving, possibly with age and origin. We’d highlight their names on the list.
A census record from 1900 or 1910 showing the Frank Konecny household in Manitowoc (to illustrate immigrant household data like language, year of immigration, occupations).
The marriage certificate of Frank and Marjorie (1947), which not only is a nice artifact but also shows their parents’ names, ages, etc.
The Colonial era deed or a facsimile of a Plymouth colony record with Henry Wood’s name (maybe a jury duty record or land grant if we find one).
Military documents: e.g., Norman B. Wood’s Army discharge papers or a commendation letter for his Silver Star; Frank’s Navy honorable discharge or a WWII draft card.
Family Tree (handwritten chart): We should show at least a portion of the scanned pedigree chart that has been referenced. Perhaps include a segment that was particularly challenging or where we show “marked-up research notes” on it. This honors the original document and also visually communicates the genealogical continuity.
Design: Many of these can be presented as overlay images within relevant pages – e.g., a faded-back image of a census form as a backdrop to Chapter 7, with a callout box explaining what it is. Or as figures with figure numbers. We must ensure they’re legible, so for small-text documents we might show an excerpt blown up. In print, we might use a fold-out or an insert page on different paper for special documents (to mimic pulling an old letter out of an archive).
Each reproduction will have a caption with context: “Passenger list of the S.S. Rhein, 1892, showing [Great-Grandfather] Konecny’s arrival in New York (line 17)” or “Certificate of Marriage for Frank J. Konecny and Marjorie M. Wood, 1947”.
We should also cite or credit the archive (e.g., “National Archives”, “Wisconsin State Historical Society”) in the bibliography, but for the outline we note that such documents will be sourced.
Digital: Could allow clicking to enlarge and read. Possibly hyperlink to full transcription if in an ebook.
General Design and Formatting Considerations (Print vs Digital):
Print: We intend a high-quality coffee table book format – likely 11 x 8.5 inches, full color. Heavy glossy paper for crisp photo reproduction. Layout will have spacious margins for a clean look and possibly sidebar text. We’ll use elegant serif fonts for main text (for a historical feel) and sans-serif or decorative fonts for sidebars and captions. Each Part might start on a right-hand page with a title spread (maybe a relevant background image). The design will be visual-forward: every spread should have at least one image or infographic to avoid big text blocks. Headings and subheadings will be in a consistent style, with Part titles perhaps using a stylized motif (like a line flourish or a small icon, e.g., a ship for Part I, a musket for Part II, a maple leaf for Part III, a beer mug for Part IV, etc., to visually hint at content). We will use color schemes that subtly reflect content (earthy tones for colonial chapters, blues/greens for Quabbin water theme, bold reds and blues for modern American era).
We will consider printing extras like a fold-out family tree chart in the back, or pockets for a DVD of family videos (if that’s desired). The cover design might feature a collage: perhaps a split with a Mayflower-era illustration on one half and a Czech immigration photo on the other, merging in the middle with a modern family photo – symbolizing the union of histories. The title and author (maybe the family name as author, or Christopher as narrator) will be on the cover and spine in an embossed font.
Digital/Web: For wider sharing, a digital version (PDF or website) will be crafted. This version will leverage interactivity: clickable footnote citations to see source details instantly, hyperlinks from the Table of Contents to sections, and possibly multimedia (audio clips of interviews, video slideshows of reunion photos, interactive family tree where hovering shows person’s details). The web version can also be continuously updated as new info comes in – aligning with the Research Opportunities section’s goal. Responsive design to allow reading on tablets and computers easily. Privacy-protected version for public sharing (with personal contact info and maybe living persons’ sensitive data omitted) should be considered, as noted for the contact sheet.
In both formats, accessibility will be considered: clear fonts, high contrast for text on images, alt text for images in digital form (so that visually impaired family can use screen readers to hear descriptions of family photos).
Lastly, we’ll maintain a cohesive branding – perhaps a family crest or logo (if none exists, we could design a simple emblem combining symbols like a Pilgrim ship, a Czech lion or flag, a Wisconsin outline, etc.) that appears on title pages or chapter openers. This gives the book a professional, finished feel, suitable for both the family living room and a local historical society’s collection.
## 6. Appendices
The appendices provide reference material, detailed data, and supporting documentation that underpin the narrative. They are crucial for readers who want to dive deeper or verify facts, and they elevate the book’s credibility and usefulness for research. The following appendices will be included:
Appendix I: Full Genealogical Tables (with citations): This is a comprehensive listing of the family lineage in text/table form, similar to a register report or ahnentafel (ancestor list). It will list generations in order, including collateral lines not fully explored in the main text. Each entry will have names, birth-marriage-death dates and places (if known), and a citation of sources for those facts. For example:
Generation 1: John Howland (b.~1592 England – d.1673 Plymouth) m. 1623 Elizabeth Tilley (b.1607 – d.1687); Sources: Bradford’s Of Plymouth Plantation, Mayflower Families vol. 23, etc.
Generation 2: Hope Howland (b.1629 Plymouth – d.?) m. John Chipman... Source: Family chart, Mayflower Society lineage papers.
... and so on, all the way to Generation 15/16 which would include the current kids.
We will probably separate into maternal and paternal lines until they join: one section for Howland→Wood line, another for Konecny line, then show the marriage merging them. If space permits, include an ahnentafel for Christopher Konecny (which lists all his direct ancestors by number, a standard genealogical format).
Citations here might use a numbered footnote system referencing a bibliography. For instance, each person’s info will have footnote numbers linking to items like “1. 2019 Wood Reunion Book, p.X; 2. Mayflower Descendant journal Vol Y; 3. Family Bible record scan, etc.” This shows the foundation of evidence behind the family tree.
This appendix might span many pages but is valuable for serious genealogy readers. It will also note where information is confident (proven) and where it’s estimated or unconfirmed (with maybe a question mark or [RESEARCH NEEDED] note for missing data). By doing so, it cross-verifies what the main narrative said and provides a resource for those continuing research.
Appendix II: Glossary of Genealogical and Historical Terms: A list of terms that a lay reader might not immediately know. This makes the book more accessible to all family members, not just the genealogists. Terms to include:
Genealogical terms: “great-great-grandparent,” “once removed” (explaining cousin relationships), “maternal/paternal line,” “lineage society,” “ahnentafel,” etc. Also abbreviations like b. for born, d. for died, m. for married (as used in charts) – though we’ll try to spell those out in the narrative, the charts use them.
Historical terms: “New England Planters” (with a brief redefinition beyond what’s in context boxes), “Acadians,” “indentured servant,” “Homestead Act” if mentioned, “Naturalization,” etc. Possibly also cultural terms like “kolache” if we mention it, or Czech words if any used.
DNA terms: if that section’s included, define “haplogroup,” “autosomal DNA,” “GEDmatch,” etc.
The glossary will be alphabetized. Each entry will be 1-3 sentences, possibly with an example from the family. For instance: “Once Removed – In cousin relationships, ‘removed’ denotes a difference in generation. For example, your parent’s first cousin is your first cousin once removed.”
Design: Possibly two-column layout in smaller font, given this is dense info. Could have small icons (like a Pilgrim hat next to historical terms, a DNA helix next to genetic terms). We’ll cite sources if definitions are taken from specific references (like quoting a dictionary of genealogy). Many definitions we can craft in-house.
Appendix III: Research Methodology Notes: This section explains how the research was conducted, adding transparency and credibility. It will discuss:
The use of primary sources (vital records, censuses, wills, military records, etc.) and where we found them. For example: “Parish registers from Middleborough were consulted on microfilm at the Massachusetts Archives; U.S. Census records from 1850–1940 via Ancestry.com” – we list out main sources and repositories.
The role of secondary sources: e.g., the Wood Family Reunion 1994 & 2019 books, published genealogies, the Mayflower Society’s approved lineage papers, local histories. We note that these were used as guides but where possible information was verified independently.
The process of reconciling the scanned handwritten family tree with modern data: describing how the tree served as a roadmap, how certain notations on it were interpreted (like the Fortune, Quabbin notes), and how we resolved any conflicts (e.g., if the chart had a misspelled name or an approximate date that we corrected via records). We will explicitly mention that the original chart was taken as authoritative where evidence was equal, out of respect to the family record, but also updated where new evidence showed corrections, always noting the change.
Mention of tools and software: perhaps a note that data was organized using genealogy software (if it was), or a simple mention of creating tables and collaborating via family group chats/emails in 2019.
Any challenges encountered: e.g., “Records in Czech were in Latin/Czech requiring translation; names were sometimes spelled differently (Konecny vs. Konečný), which we normalized.”
This section can also serve as a guide for future researchers on how to do genealogy, using our project as a case study.
Sources: We’ll cite any methodological references (like if we follow a specific standard, say the Genealogical Proof Standard from the Board for Certification of Genealogists – we could mention that, citing the BCG handbook). But largely, this is narrative from our experience compiling the info.
Appendix IV: Source Citations and Bibliography: A comprehensive list of all sources referenced in the book, formatted in a consistent citation style (Chicago, APA, or a genealogy-specific style). It will likely be divided into Manuscript Sources, Books, Articles, Websites, and Personal Communications. We ensure the three provided sources are prominently cited:
From the Mayflower to the Midwest: A History of the Konecny Family – likely as an unpublished manuscript or report by [author/family historian], date. We might treat it like a report and cite within footnotes as needed etc., but here we give full credit.
Wood Family Genealogy – Updated for the 2019 Reunion – cite as compiled by [Beth Moorcones, et al., 2019], possibly privately printed. We’ll reference specific pages when used (some footnotes we have might point to it).
Handwritten Konecny Family Tree Chart – cite as “Konecny Family Tree (hand-drawn chart), creator [if known, or just Family Heirloom], c.20th century, digital scan 2023”. We emphasize it as an unpublished family document.
Other sources likely included: Mayflower Society publications, vital records (like “Middleborough Vital Records to 1850”), census data (with NARA microfilm IDs), military records, books or articles on Quabbin, etc. Also possibly cite general history books used for context (like a book on New England Planters or a history of Manitowoc).
Design: In print, a smaller font, listed alphabetically or by footnote number. The Citations might be endnotes keyed by chapter, whereas the Bibliography is a general list. We may do both if needed: e.g., numbered endnotes for precise references and a general bibliography for further reading. Digital version will hyperlink each citation to the source if available online. We will ensure all 【source†L#-L#】 citations in the text correspond to entries here for clarity (in the final product, presumably the actual system will show sources when hovering).
Appendix V: Contact Sheet for Living Relatives (Privacy-Protected Version): This appendix is intended for the family’s private edition of the book. It will list the names and contact information of current family members who consent to be included, to facilitate communication and future reunions.
It might be organized by family branch or geography. For example: “Descendants of Peter Konecny: [names of Chris, siblings, etc. with emails]; Descendants of Michael Konecny: ... Descendants of Virginia Wood Dagel’s family: ...” etc. For each, we could have phone, email, and city of residence. We will NOT include this in any public-facing copy.
Possibly include a note like, “(This section is omitted in the public version to protect privacy.)” and indeed have two versions of the PDF, one with and one without this section.
Design: Simple table or list format, nothing fancy. Perhaps a small headshot if available for each person, as a mini directory. But likely just text for practicality.
We’ll include a disclaimer that this info is current as of X date and ask not to distribute it outside the family. And encourage updating it – maybe even leave space to write in updates.
## 7. [RESEARCH NEEDED] Flags and Next Steps
Throughout the outline, we identified several areas needing further verification or discovery. Below is a consolidated list of those [RESEARCH NEEDED] items, each with concrete next steps to guide future research efforts:
Czech Parish Records for the Konecny Family [RESEARCH NEEDED]: The exact hometown in Bohemia for Frank Konecny’s parents is not yet confirmed. Next Steps: Locate baptismal or birth records in Czech archives (likely in Southern Bohemia circa 1860s-1880s). Start with surname Konečný in databases like actapublica.eu (Catholic parish registers). If language is a barrier, hire a Czech genealogist or utilize online forums. Obtaining these records will solidify the European lineage and possibly connect with distant relatives or explain the reason for emigration (e.g., records might show occupation or notes). Additionally, check for Austro-Hungarian Empire emigration permits or databases for those leaving Bohemia.
Immigration and Naturalization Documents (1889–1899) [RESEARCH NEEDED]: While we know the Konecny family immigrated around this window, we have not yet found ship passenger lists or naturalization papers. Next Steps: Search Ellis Island records (post-1892) and Castle Garden (pre-1892) for variations of the name (including alternate spellings like “Konecni” or “Koneshny”). Look at ships arriving in New York, Baltimore, or even Canada (some immigrants entered via Montreal/Quebec then went to the US). Once likely arrival is found, obtain the ship manifest for a copy. For naturalization, check indexes in Wisconsin (Manitowoc County) circa 1890s-1910s; many counties kept naturalization ledgers. The National Archives Chicago branch might hold regional naturalization files. These documents will give exact arrival dates and places of origin.
Military Service Documentation [RESEARCH NEEDED]: Further documentation of ancestors’ military service would enhance the narrative and provide official proof of their roles. Next Steps:
For Philip Wood (Revolutionary War): Look for Revolutionary War pension or bounty land application files under his name in the National Archives. Also, the DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution) database could have a record if a descendant joined using his lineage; that often provides his service details (regiment, rank).
For any Civil War involvement: If we suspect a family member (perhaps a sibling of an ancestor) served, search the Civil War Soldiers and Sailors database by surname in relevant states (Massachusetts, Illinois, etc.). Check also the 1890 Veterans Schedule census for any Wood/Bentley in Wisconsin.
For Norman B. Wood (WWI & WWII): Request his military personnel file (Standard Form 180 through the National Personnel Records Center). Since Norman died in 1950, his records should be available to next-of-kin. This could yield his enlistment, ranks, and citation texts for his medals (Silver Star citation etc.).
For Frank Konecny (WWII): Similarly, obtain his service record. Also check if he might have recorded an oral history or if there are naval records of the ship(s) he served on.
These documents, once obtained, can be added as footnotes or even excerpts in future editions.
Quabbin Property Deeds and Land Records [RESEARCH NEEDED]: To verify the “original proprietors” claim and get specifics on the family’s land, more digging in Massachusetts archives is needed. Next Steps:
Search the Massachusetts Land Records (Hampshire County or Franklin County, depending on which county those towns were in) for the surnames Wood, Nelson, Short, etc., in the 1730-1770 period. Deeds might show purchase of land in Prescott, Greenwich, etc.
Investigate if there was a list made of families affected by Quabbin’s creation – sometimes the Metropolitan District Commission published such lists. The Massachusetts State Library or Archives could assist.
Visit or contact the Quabbin Reservoir Administration – they maintain historical info on the valley. Possibly they have records or can confirm if the Wood family name appears in town records or on monuments.
If found, we can pinpoint exactly which ancestor owned land there and perhaps map it. This will change a family legend into a documented fact.
DNA Interpretation and Expansion [RESEARCH NEEDED]: As the family delves into genetic genealogy, deeper analysis can unlock new information. Next Steps:
Encourage more family members (especially from different branches) to take autosomal DNA tests to increase match data. Focus on oldest generation members for more direct links.
Utilize Y-DNA testing for a male-line descendant of the Konecny line to see if matches appear in Czech databases or projects – could connect with other Konecny families globally. Similarly, an mtDNA test from someone in the direct maternal line of, say, Marjorie’s maternal lineage might link to other descendants of those colonial women.
Engage with online tools: upload raw DNA data to GEDmatch to use their ancestry painting and one-to-many matching for potentially finding unknown distant cousins who might have pieces of the puzzle (like photos or Bible records).
Consult a genetic genealogist to interpret any anomalies: e.g., if someone’s results show a trace of unexpected ethnicity (maybe 2% Indigenous American or Jewish, etc.), they can help trace which ancestor it might come from.
Document all findings and integrate them into the narrative (for example, “DNA evidence confirms the connection to John Howland’s lineage, as several segment matches were found among known Howland descendants, providing genetic corroboration of the paper trail”).
Cemetery and Burial Records [RESEARCH NEEDED]: Visiting and documenting family graves can provide missing dates and a tangible connection to ancestors. Next Steps:
Compile a list of known burial sites from the family tree. Then systematically find their graves: for instance, Frank and Marjorie are likely in Holy Cross or Pioneer Rest Cemetery in Two Rivers – get photos of their tombstones (maybe already done by findagrave). Do the same for Norman and Mae Wood (likely Two Rivers as well).
For ancestors back in New England: check FindAGrave.com for memorials of people like Henry Wood (there’s often info posted by volunteers). If not, look into cemetery transcriptions published (Old First Cemetery Middleborough, etc.). If any are missing, one might plan a trip to those towns to locate graves (if they weren’t moved in Quabbin’s case).
In Bohemia, if the hometown is found, see if the church has a graveyard with family plots – contacting local historians might help.
Recording these will not only fill in exact birth/death dates (if any were incomplete) but also might reveal previously unknown family members (a headstone might list an infant or spouse we didn’t know about). It’s also a way to honor those ancestors by including photographs of their grave markers in the book or at least transcriptions in the appendix.
Tie this to the tradition: maybe at the next reunion, organize a field trip to the family plot in Two Rivers to educate the younger generation.
(The above [RESEARCH NEEDED] items are noted in the relevant chapters of the book as well, but this appendix consolidates them for clarity. By following these steps, future updates of the family history can include new discoveries, ensuring that the Konecny family story continues to grow richer and more accurate.)

Sources Used: This outline incorporated material from the family’s research document “From the Mayflower to the Midwest: A History of the Konecny Family”, the Wood Family Reunion Book (2019), and insights from the scanned Konecny family tree (as referenced in the narrative). All genealogical connections and historical anecdotes have been cross-verified against these sources and cited where applicable. Discrepancies were noted (e.g., resolved questions from the chart) and the original family tree was used as the final arbiter in cases of conflict. The outline also integrates general historical knowledge to supplement the family-specific sources (e.g., context of the Planter migration and Quabbin history), ensuring a robust and factual foundation for the envisioned book.
